    "description": "Award-winning* demonstration of gravity, featuring the \"Spacetime Stretcher,\"  built mostly out of materials from my garage and the hardware store. Please support me on Patreon! Thank you! http://www.patreon.com/edwardcurrent\n\nMore info:\n\n1. As a falling object's path goes increasingly in the space (down) direction, it goes a little bit less in the time direction. Gravity is effectively converting some of its travel through time into travel through space. How much time converts into how much space? It works out to be 186,000 miles of space for every second of time -- that's the speed of light! The equivalence between a little time and a lot of space has a parallel with Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2, where a little mass is equivalent to a lot of energy -- also with the speed of light c as the conversion factor, only squared. It's amazing how all these physics concepts fit together.\n\n2. An object moving up or down at the speed of light, such as a photon, follows a vertical path on our graph. If we could warp the Spacetime Stretcher as much as we wanted, we could make the time axis curve around and re-intersect with this vertical line. That would be a black hole: Even a photon moving straight up would get \"warped back\" to the place where it started.\n\n3. Spacetime warping is usually depicted as going into a higher dimension -- in this case, bending toward or away from the camera. But such a device would have been much harder to build. You can think of this model as a two-dimensional \"projection\" or \"shadow\" of three-dimensional curvature, i.e. the flattening of a flared-out surface that curls away from the plane of the graph.\n\n4. In addition to mechanically calculating trajectories of objects falling on the Earth, Mars, or Moon, the Spacetime Stretcher (at a zoomed-out calibration scale) can also calculate the length-contraction and time-dilation observed with a rocket traveling close to the speed of light.\n* http://fqxi.org/community/contest/video/winners/2014.1",

But our intense awareness of the negatives is in danger of creating a misleadingly narrow view of the subject. Drugs are \u2013 at best \u2013 serious, dignified, noble and important, and we need more of them in our lives....\u201d\nYou can read more on this and many other topics on our blog TheBookofLife.org: https://goo.gl/PQlio4 \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/j6QPBm \n\nMore films on SELF in our playlist below: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself \n\nDo you speak a different language to English?

    "description": "Scientists are pretty sure black holes are real. Soon they'll know for sure.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nThe biggest problem with trying to detect a black hole is that even the supermassive ones are relatively tiny.\n\n\"The largest one in the sky [is] the black hole in the center of the Milky Way,\" Dimitrios Psaltis, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, writes me in an email. \"And taking a picture of it would be equivalent to taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon.\"\n\nWhat's more, because of their strong gravity, black holes tend to be surrounded by other bright matter that makes it hard to see the object itself.\n\nThat's why, when hunting for black holes, astronomers don't usually try for direct observation. Instead, they look for evidence of the effects of a black hole's gravity and radiation.\n\nBut an ongoing effort is linking up several radio telescopes around the world in an effort to see a black hole up close for the first time. The historic image is due in 2017. \n\nRead more: http://www.vox.com/2016/2/23/11095624/what-does-a-black-hole-actually-look-like\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

    "description": "Betrayal is part of giving trust, says JetBlue Chairman Joel Peterson. So the odds are you will be betrayed at some point in time. Still, recovery and healing are possible.  Peterson's book is \"The 10 Laws of Trust:  Building the Bonds That Make a Business Great\" (http://goo.gl/oIG94o).\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/joel-peterson-on-coping-with-betrayal\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - So betrayal is a very tough thing and it\u2019s part of giving trust is the odds are you will be betrayed at some point in time. So getting good at dealing with betrayal is a really important thing. And I think it starts with realizing that you have joint ventured the betrayal. You\u2019ve had a part to do with it. It could be that you trusted when you shouldn\u2019t have trusted. You didn\u2019t think about whether the person had high character, was competent and had the authority and therefore shame on you. We don\u2019t like to take responsibility for that but I think if you step back and say how did I participate in this? I think that gives you insight and sort of the first ability to start approaching it in a way that allows you to heal. Because that\u2019s really what you want to do in a betrayal is you want to heal as fast as you can. And so I think it really helps to do that. \n\nSo any time you\u2019re betrayed you feel alone. You feel like why me? You have the poor me\u2019s and you feel like you\u2019ve been attacked and it\u2019s all unfair and everything. I think if you step back and say everybody\u2019s been betrayed, everybody knows what this feels like and people get over it. And therefore I\u2019m not alone in this and I can learn from other people and this too will pass. So sometimes when you\u2019re in the midst of it and you\u2019re dealing with it and it\u2019s acute it feels like it\u2019s all you can think about. You wake up in the middle of the night it\u2019s the first thing on your mind. When you start your day it stays with you throughout the day and you start to marinate in it. And I think it\u2019s really helpful to step back and say this has happened to other people before and therefore I will get through this.\n\nSo sometimes people betray us and it\u2019s not that serious. They didn\u2019t deliver a project on time or on budget or they didn\u2019t get the report done right or they didn\u2019t double check their spelling. There are all kinds of levels of betrayal. And some of them really are just fumbles, stumbles, poor judgment or whatever. Others are really very serious where somebody has cheated you or told a lie or spread gossip or something like that. So I think you have to sort of calibrate what is the nature of this betrayal. lIf it is one of the former I think you can step in and say we need to come to an understanding so this doesn\u2019t happen again. Many times it\u2019s really just a question of having clarity around things and the betrayal is overcome. If it is something more serious than that it may take a whole lot more work and that work may not be worth it. In many cases it is not worth it. Certain kinds of betrayal are just not worth fixing.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve been betrayed there are, sometimes there are elements, for example, if it\u2019s just bad information or you can fix it quickly. If it\u2019s early on in somebody\u2019s career fix it quickly. Don\u2019t let the betrayal fester. Don\u2019t allow it to go on. Deal with it immediately. So fix those kinds of things quickly. Because otherwise they get worse and you may bury them for a while only to see them raise their head in an uglier form down the road. So I think you want to address even the beginnings of something that feels like it might be a betrayal. Even one of these minor betrayals.\n\nSo this idea about being realistic about the potential for recovery really comes into assessing the nature of the betrayal. If it is a serious betrayal, an infidelity, something that is really attacking you at your core, many divorces happen over this kind of thing and it\u2019s really better off that people separate because there\u2019s no point in trying to make something work that just won\u2019t work. Within a company framework I always say that you need to get the wrong people off the bus. There are people in most companies that shouldn\u2019t be there and therefore you need to \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a betrayal of them to keep them on the bus and they\u2019re betraying the company by staying on the bus. So I think some things you just have to address and move on and just say this is a betrayal I\u2019m not going to try to fix.  Read Full Transcript Here:  http://goo.gl/I8Clcf.",

There, officials listen to what are sometimes the pilots' final, panicked moments of life. They interpret not only what the pilots were saying before the crash but also any snaps, bangs, and alarms captured by the cockpit area microphone.\n\nBy combining those audio clues with data from the plane's instruments and sensors, as well as evidence from the scene, investigators can usually determine the cause of the crash, even in cases with no surviving witnesses.\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Little research has been done on the function of Duvernoy\u2019s glands in non-venomous snakes but in most species, its secretions appear to be used as lubrication to aid in swallowing. Enzymes are also produced that may aid in killing, paralyzing, and digesting prey but these functions appear to be limited in their power and are only found in certain species. \nhttp://people.whitman.edu/~jacksok/ZJLS.pdf\n\nhttp://www.public.wsu.edu/~kkardong/Web%20of%20KVK_06b/Publications/Evolution_venom_app82.pdf\n\n============================\nHow do blood clots form?\n============================\nRead an overview of how the blood clotting cascade functions and may have evolved:\nhttp://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/DI/clot/Clotting.html\n\nWatch a cool 3D animation showing how Factor X interacts with other molecules and structures in the blood to form clots!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy3a__OOa2M",

    "description": "The iterated prisoner's dilemma is just like the regular game except you play it multiple times with an opponent and add up the scores. But it can change the strategy and has more real world applications as it resembles a relationship.\n\nTHE PRISONER'S DILEMMA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw\n\nFOOT NOTES\nAdditional requirements for an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game\n\nFor a one off prisoner\u2019s dilemma, they payoffs can just be like 5 greater than 3 greater than 1 greater than 0 (like in the video). But for an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game to be an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, the total payout for both cooperating has to be bigger than the total payout for one person cooperating and one person defecting. Basically 2x3 greater than 5+0. \nIf it was like 8 points for defecting while the other cooperates, it would still follow the on off prisoners dilemma format, 8 greater than 3 greater than 1 greater than 0. But with an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game the best strategy would be to go back and forth between cooperating and defecting (giving them on average 4 each, rather than 3 for both cooperating). Which can happen for sure, but it\u2019s a different sort of game.\nWith a one-off prisoner\u2019s dilemma this doesn\u2019t matter so much. Trade might change the relationship, but it should still appear as a prisoner\u2019s dilemma. The incentives that make it the prisoner\u2019s dilemma would be the same. Their best strategies would still be to always defect. \n\n\nTournament 1 vs tournament 2 (A set number of rounds vs not knowing when it ends)\n\nThere is a bit of a logical quirk when the players know how many rounds there are. A big part of game theory is getting into your opponents head, predicting what they will do. Also thinking about the whole game and reasoning backwards.\nSo when they know how many rounds there are, the last round against any given opponent, has no consequences. If you defect in the first round the opponent can reciprocate and you probably won\u2019t be better off or it. But an opponent can\u2019t reciprocate against any defecting in that last round. And since no matter what the other person is going to do, defecting gives a better payout. A player should defect in the last round... so should everyone really. They will only get more for doing that. We should expect them to do it.\nBut then if everyone is defecting in the last round, not in response to anything that happened before, then really the second to last round also has no consequences. Nobody is going to defect because you defected in the second to last round. What they\u2019re doing in that next round is already set, if we defect in the second to last round we\u2019re not giving up future gains we could have gotten while cooperating. So everyone should defect in the second to last round because there are no consequences and the payoff is higher. But then if everyone is defecting in these rounds, then the third to last round also has no consequences\u2026. Blah blah, defect the whole time. With this reasoning the correct strategy is to always defect. \nBut we already know that ALWAYS DEFECT isn\u2019t a great strategy here. Because defecting has consequences. \nBut reasoning backwards, in this context, only works if everyone is doing it. If everyone has thought that way. If everyone reasoned this way, then everyone is always defecting. Then always defecting is the best strategy against that.  \nBut the people who submitted for this tournament clearly didn\u2019t reason this way. \nMaybe because most of the time in the real world, we don\u2019t know how many rounds there are, so we always think our actions will have consequences. Also we rarely interact with one person in isolation. We can build a reputation for being un-cooperative. If we are dicks to people who we are about to never see again those who will may not want to cooperate with us as much. So those who submitted thought like this. \nMaybe because they didn\u2019t know about the idea. \nBut even still, in the context of that tournament it would still better to defect in the last round. I suspect TIT FOR TAT or FORGIVING TIT FOR TAT modified to defect in the last round would have won... in the tournaments at least. If you're done with a relationship and you kill them and take your stuff, the people watching you won'y want to cooperate with you.\nFor that tournament they actually changed the definition of what a \u201cnice\u201d strategy was to allow defecting in those last few rounds against an opponent. The weird space where the two ideas meet.\n\n\nCooperating with whom? \n\nCooperation and defection refer to between the two players. Not necessarily with outside forces like with the police.\n\nPatreon https://patreon.com/user?u=849925",

Debris coalesces to create rocky 'planetesimals' that collide and grow to eventually form planets. The results of this study show that small planets form around stars with a wide range of heavy element content suggesting that their existence might be widespread in the galaxy.

    "description": "source paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1489\r\n\r\nWe use SPH simulations with an approximate radiative cooling prescription to model evolution of a massive and large (100 AU) very young protoplanetary disc. We also model dust growth and gas-grain dynamics with a second fluid approach. It is found that the disc fragments onto a large number of 10 Jupiter mass clumps that cool and contract slowly. Some of the clumps evolve onto eccentric orbits delivering them into the inner tens of AU, where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star. Dust grows and sediments inside the clumps, displaying a very strong segregation, with the largest particles forming dense cores in the centers. The density of the dust cores may exceed that of the gas and is limited only by the numerical constraints, indicating that these cores should collapse into rocky planetary cores. One particular giant planet embryo migrates inward close enough to be disrupted at about 10 AU, leaving a self-bound solid core of about 7.5 Earth's mass on a low eccentricity orbit at a radius of 8 AU. These simulations support the recent suggestions that terrestrial and giant planets may be the remnants of tidally disrupted giant planet embryos.\r\n\r\ncredit: Seung-Hoon Cha, Sergei Nayakshin\r\n\r\nsource: http://www.astro.le.ac.uk/~shc14/",

Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas, principal scientist at Google, works with deep neural networks for machine perception and distributed learning.

    "description": "The semantics of the model I'm working from use common goods/common property/ common pool resources (resources used by multiple people) and common property regimes (the institutions or social arrangements between people, the property rights regarding common pool resources).  \n\nWe were taught that \"the commons\" is sort of an old term. It has issues because it blankets both common pool resources with no communication, no rules, no accountability, no punishment for those who break the rules, etc. (open access) and common pool resources with some cooperation or institution in place (common property regimes). \n\nWhen you get away from those aspects that allow people to trust one another and work together, the system looks like an open access system. The tragedy of the commons model describes what happens in that open access system. But not what happens when a common property regime is in place. But the term \"commons\" doesn't distinguish between the two. \n\nFurther watching\nSome Field Ecology \n\" Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi...\n\nPatreon https://patreon.com/user?u=849925",

    "description": "You can now support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/statedclearly\n\nAll living creatures today reproduce and evolve using a complex gene-enzyme cycle. If we look at a cell, for example, information encoded in its genes is used to produce functional proteins called enzymes. Some of those enzymes then turn around to make copies of the cell's genes, allowing the cell to reproduce. \n\nBecause the gene-enzyme system forms a closed loop, it presents us with a classic chicken or egg conundrum: Which came first, genes or the protein enzymes they code for? \n\nWhile the details are still not fully worked out, discoveries over the past few decades have lead researchers to a surprising possible solution: What really came first? Genes that act as enzymes!\n\nThe RNA World Hypothesis is the idea that before living cells, the genetic code, and the gene/protein cycle ever existed, chains of a chemical called RNA were forming naturally. Once formed, some of these chains were able to function as enzymes, and were even able to evolve by making copies of themselves with slight, accidental modifications.\n\nWhile there is little doubt that RNA played a crucial role in the early development of life, the complexity of RNA is casting doubt on the idea that RNA was the first truly replicating and evolving chemical system. For this reason, alternatives to the \u201cRNA first\u201d view are also being investigated. Most notable is a proto-RNA hypothesis being studied by the lab of Nicholas Hud, and several metabolism first hypotheses which got their start from the work of Robert Shapiro.\n\nAt this time, all serious investigations into the origin of life are being done under the overarching idea that life emerged from chemistry.\n\nSOURCES AND FURTHER READING\n\nRIBOZYMES\nThe first RNA enzymes were discovered in 1982, now known as ribozymes. Here\u2019s is a wonderful review of what we now know about ribozymes (well... as of 2002): \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770912/\n\nDiverse and highly functional ribozymes can be evolved in the lab. Selection experiments have shown there are many pathways that evolution can take to produce a ribozyme with a given function. This means the evolution of function is much simpler than previously thought! \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902939/\n\nNucleotide building ribozymes have been evolved in the lab from random starting chains (this is the experiment discussed in our animation):\n\nScientific Paper: http://www.sfu.ca/~punrau/pdfs/Lau_JACS_2004.pdf\n\nINITIAL RNA NUCLEOTIDE SYNTHESIS\nRNA nucleotides have been shown to form without enzymes under conditions that might have been plausible on the early Earth. That said, the reactions we\u2019ve discovered so far do not appear robust enough to claim that the problem is fully solved: \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/abs/nature08013.html\n\n\nNature News overview of the discovery with objections discussed: http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090513/full/news.2009.471.html\n\nRNA REPLICATION BEFORE EVOLUTION OF ENZYMES\n8 problems with RNA replication and likely solutions to them (note: number 8 now has two independent solutions demonstrated in the lab): \n\nScientific Paper: https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-3-2\n\nALTERNATIVES TO THE RNA WORLD HYPOTHESIS \nHere is an article reviewing the metabolism first hypothesis in contrast to the RNA first view:\n\nBlog post by professor Laurance Moran: http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/metabolism-first-and-origin-of-life.html\n\nHere is an article reviewing research into a possible proto RNA World Hypothesis: \n\nMedia article by quanta magazine\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/20140205-chemists-pursue-possible-precursor-to-rna/\n\nLearn more about evolution and the origin of life at http://statedclearly.com and at http://centerforchemicalevolution.com",

Since there is a discrepancy between general relativity and quantum mechanics, we continue to search for a grand unifying theory... one which may finally lead to a description of the actual moment of the Big Bang! On this week's Space Time, Matt describes what specifically needs fixing within the current theory, and the reasons why.\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\nElectroweak Era\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_epoch\n_____________________\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nElectroMechaCat \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPStj2ZuXug&lc=z13iinc5vyemsbk5l04cjrbalxjqd5pgzcw\n\nKalakashi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPStj2ZuXug&lc=z13ov1c4ipqydv0cm235ydgjszy2jpzou04\n\nJames Beech\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPStj2ZuXug&lc=z12jgfjafmufg54fj23od1ibvny4jpl5404\n\n______________________\n\nWritten and hosted by Matt O\u2019Dowd \nMade by Kornhaber Brown (www.kornhaberbrown.com)",

The internet is such a crucial tool in our daily lives today that we hardly remember that it hasn't been here forever. But yeah, it is actually not that old.

Well, let's explore how the internet came into existence and why. \n\nAnd another Kurzgesagt video that isn't depressing! Don't get used to it though. \n\nWe funny comments at the end of the video are real comments from real people, from old YGS Episodes from Jacksfilms: youtube.com/jacksfilms\n\nThe MUSIC is available here: http://bit.ly/1hvOiYO\n\nThanks to Max from Moby Digg for the cat ;)\n\nwww.Kurzgesagt.org\n\nIf you like the MUSIC of the video, you can get it here: http://bit.ly/1fCOlLI\n\nNext Video: May.

    "description": "http://skunkbear.tumblr.com\n\nIt was just over two centuries ago that the global population was 1 billion \u2014 in 1804. But better medicine and improved agriculture resulted in higher life expectancy for children, dramatically increasing the world population, especially in the West.\n\nAs higher standards of living and better health care are reaching more parts of the world, the rates of fertility \u2014 and population growth \u2014 have started to slow down, though the population will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nU.N. forecasts suggest the world population could hit a peak of 10.1 billion by 2100 before beginning to decline. But exact numbers are hard to come by \u2014 just small variations in fertility rates could mean a population of 15 billion by the end of the century.\n\nProduced by Adam Cole\nCinematography by Maggie Starbard",

    "description": "Everything we know about physics - and a few things we don't - in a simple map.\n\nIf you are interested in buying a print you can buy it as a poster here: http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/24105984-the-map-of-physics?asc=u&p=poster&rel=carousel\n\nOr on a load of other objects: http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/24105984-the-map-of-physics?asc=u\n\nAlso you can download a digital version here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/30976775430/in/dateposted-public/\n\nI made the music, which you can find on my Soundcloud if you'd like to get lost in some cosmic jam. https://soundcloud.com/dominicwalliman\n\nErrata and clarifications.\n\nI endeavour to be as accurate as possible in my videos, but I am human and definitely don\u2019t know everything, so there are sometimes mistakes. Also, due to the nature of my videos, there are bound to be oversimplifications. Some of these are intentional because I don\u2019t have time to go into full detail, but sometimes they are unintentional and here is where I clear them up.\n\n1. \u201cIsaac Newton invented calculus.\u201d Actually there is controversy over who invented calculus first Isaac Newton or Gottfried Leibniz. Regardless of who it was I have used Leibniz\u2019s mathematical notation here and so he definitely deserves credit. I did\u2019t know about all this so thanks to those who pointed it out. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy\n2. \u201cMaxwell derived the laws of electromagnetism.\u201d This is a simplification as Maxwell\u2019s work was built on the backs of other scientists like Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, Andr\u00e9-Marie Ampl\u00e8re and Michael Faraday who discovered induction and saw that electricity and magnetism were part of the same thing. But it was Maxwell who worked out all the maths and brought electricity and magnetism together into a unified theory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism#History_of_the_theory\n3. \u201cEntropy is a measure of order and disorder\u201d. This is also a simplification and this does a good job of explaining it better https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy\n4. Einstein and Quantum physics: I made it sound like quantum physics was built by people other than Einstein, but this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Einstein got a Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect which was a key result to show the particle-like nature of light. Funnily enough he never got a nobel prize for his work on Relativity!\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this video, you will probably like my science books, available in all good books shops around the work and is printed in 16 languages. Links are below or just search for Professor Astro Cat. They are fun children's books aimed at the age range 7-12. But they are also a hit with adults who want good explanations of science.

In the awe-inspiring sense of the word awesome. In this episode, we walk you through the start of everything: The Big Bang. We'll look at how the universe unfolded at its very beginning, and how everything in the universe that we know today came into being.

This transition, as well as several other major evolutionary transitions, dramatically increased the complexity of lifeforms on our planet. \n\nIf you enjoyed the show, please consider supporting us at patreon.com/statedclearly\n\nto see the animation on bees, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J83qyLXAsN4\n\n------------SOURCES------------\n\nOVERVIEW OF MAJOR TRANSITIONS\n\nThis animation was based on a paper by Stuart West et al called Major Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality which can be accessed free here: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10112.full.pdf\n\nDr West's paper defines major transitions in a slightly narrower way than earlier workers on the subject. For a broader definition see the book by John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry on the topic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Major_Transitions_in_Evolution\n\nMITOCHONDRIA\n\nThe paper by Dr Margulis (Sagan) on the origin of mitochondria. Note that in it she presents several ideas cautiously as hypothesis. While some aspects of the paper are now known to be incorrect, she was spot on about the origin of mitochondria: http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge246/endosymbiotictheory_marguli.pdf\n\nVIROIDS\n\nThe free living genes discovered by Dr Diener were made of RNA. Here is a paper on them: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682271903424\n\nHere is an excellent Wikipedia article on them I suggest looking over first. It includes a schematic of the species Diener found: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viroid \n\nEXPERIMENTS SHOWN IN THIS ANIMATION\n\nPhagotrophy by a flagellate selects for colonial prey: A possible origin of multicellularity: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006527528063\n\nExperimental evolution of multicellularity:\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/109/5/1595\n\nAuto-/heterotrophic endosymbiosis evolves in a mature stage of ecosystem development in a microcosm composed of an alga, a bacterium and a ciliate [what a catchy title!]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19162125",

    "description": "Everything you need to know about gravitational waves. In February 2016 scientists announced the first detection of gravitational waves by humans on Earth. This was a huge, world changing, discovery. The gravitational waves were caused by a pair of colliding black holes 1.3 billion light years away 1.3 billion years ago. This video summaries all the of the mind blowing facts about the gravitational waves and describes LIGO, the incredibly sensitive telescope that detected them.\n\nIf you would like to buy a poster you can get one here http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/24649310-gravitational-wave-astronomy?asc=u&p=poster&rel=carousel\n\nErrata and clarifications.\n\nI endeavour to be as accurate as possible in my videos, but I am human and definitely don\u2019t know everything, so there are sometimes mistakes. Also, because my videos are summaries of some quite complex science, I make simplifications. Some of these are intentional because I don\u2019t have time to go into full detail, but sometimes they are unintentional and here is where I clear them up.\n\n1. I got the month of the original detection wrong! It was September 2015, not November 2015. Silly me, my apologies.\n2. \u201c1.3 billion years ago, 1.3 billion light years away\u201d This is incorrect and an oversight on my part. I completely forgot to take into account the expansion of the Universe. The resulting black hole is 1.3 billion light years from us today, but was closer to us when the collision happened, which means that it happened less than 1.3 billion years ago. I tried to work out exactly when but was stumped because I couldn\u2019t find the function for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. The redshift of the signal from the black holes was about 10%, so I thought the collision was 10% closer in time than 1.3 billion years i.e. 1.18 billion years, but I think it might be a bit more complicated than that. \n3. LIGO schematic animation. I made a couple of silly errors here. The first circular mirror that the laser hits should be 90\u00ba to the way I oriented it: half the laser light is transmitted and half reflected, each one going up a different arm.\n4. LIGO schematic animation. When the laser bounced back and forth it should bounce between the two suspended mirrors and not go all the way back to the diagonal mirror.\n5. VIRGO is near Pisa, not at Trento as I drew on the map. I said the right thing but drew the wrong thing. My apologies.\n6. \u2018A second even more powerful collision.\u201d Wrong again! The second collision was less powerful and the signal was more buried in the noise.\n\nI\u2019m not happy with the number of flat out mistakes I made on this one! I will try better in the future. I blame it on the Christmas spirits.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about gravitational waves and the detection here are the original papers and some very informative links.\n\nMain LIGO scientific paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102\nSupplementary LIGO paper: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L22\n\nArticles:\nhttp://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/feb/11/ligo-detects-first-ever-gravitational-waves-from-two-merging-black-holes\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/black-hole-collision-energy-50-times-universe-2016-2\nhttp://www.space.com/33176-gravitational-waves-from-second-black-hole-collision.html\nhttp://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/gravitational-waves-6-cosmic-questions-they-can-tackle-1.19337\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nWhat they sound like:\nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/6/15/11948618/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-hole-sound\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this video, you will probably like my science books, available in all good books shops around the work and is printed in 16 languages.

    "description": "Research assignment: Teach me about spin.\n\nBelow there are suggested questions, recommended sources and my social media accounts:\n\nQUESTIONS:\nQuestions that require less research:\n1. This is our first real example of quantization, the phenomena that gives quantum mechanics it\u2019s name. Here\u2019s what it means. In the classical case of magnets going through a Stern Gerlach machine, the magnets can end up any where in the range. But in quantum mechanics, its can only be exactly up or down, these discrete values rather than a continuous range in between. This sort of quantization really bothered physicists. Can you understand why? And is there any classical physics phenomenon that also has sort of quantization?\n\n2. Do you think that eventually all quantities in physics can be explained in terms of deeper physics? Are there any examples of quantities that later on did get explained through a more encompassing theory?\n\n3. How can you use the Stern-Gerlach machine to measure spin in the \u2018forward-backward\u2019 direction? \n\n4. Why do half the particles go left, half right at 4:24? \n\n\n\nQuestions that (probably) require research:\n\n5. What are bosons and fermions? What\u2019s spin got to do with it? If you really want to get into it, read ch 4, volume 3 of The Feynman Lectures: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html\n\n6. Electrons are so-called spin 1/2 particles. Are there any other spin types? What determines what spin a particle will have?\n\n7. How does spin relate to the Pauli exclusion principle?\n\n8. Explain how the Stern-Gerlach machine works\n\n9. Is light polarization a type of spin? What are arguments for and against this? What spin does a photon have (spin 1/2, spin 1 etc)?\n\n10. Why is it that charged particles moving causes magnetic fields- according to Einstein? (Look up relativity and electromagnetism)\n\n11. What\u2019s wrong with saying the electron is infinitely small? What experiments measure the electrons size? Are protons also infinitely small? \n\n12. Find other reasons we don\u2019t believe electrons are actually spinning. (An interesting one is about rotating a spin particle 360 degrees, and not getting back the exact same wavefunction.)\n\n13. a) What is the Bloch Sphere, and why can we use it to represent spin? How do you visualise the spin left state on it? how about spin forward? (http://comp.uark.edu/~jgeabana/blochapps/bloch.html , note that a 2-level system is any particle that only has two options when measured (eg only up or down). |0) and |1) are the generic labels we\u2019ll put on these options)\nb) Also, How do you write spin forward in terms of up and down (i.e. |forward)=a|up)+b|down))? You will probably need to look this up, so it\u2019s useful to know the spin \u201cup/down\u201dness is usually called spin in the z direction, spin \u201cleft/right\u201dness is spin in the x direction, and spin \u201cforward/backward\u201d is spin in the y direction. You can figure this out by looking at the Bloch sphere.\n\n14. Magnetic Resonance Imaginging (MRI) is an important clinical technic that completely relies on manipulating spin. Explain it! http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetic_resonance_imaging\n\n15. What happens to the electrons if you put them into the Stern-Gerlach machine and then slowly rotated from up and down to side and side, do some of the electrons switch places? (Thank you Majoofi)\n\n16. Why aren't there magnetic monopoles? (Thanks Culwin)\n\n17. What is isospin? Why is it that, even though it hasn't got the units of angular momentum, it still 'formally acts like spin?' according to Wiki? (Thanks Hythloday71)\n\nRECOMMENDED SOURCES ON SPIN\nThe Feynman lectures, Volume 3: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html\n\nQuantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particle Physics- Eisberg and Resnick, the chapters of angular momentum and spin. This is a good one if you already know basic classical electromagnetism. Don't buy it, just visit your local university library and just read it there. \n\nSneaking a Look at God's Cards - Ghirardi. This is one of my favourite quantum books. It talks about the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n\nWikipedia or Scholarpedia. These are always a good place to start- though sometimes they can throw you into the maths. Don't panic if you don't get all of it. Just try to glean the main idea, and that's more than enough to report here. Hopefully then others can help with any details that were confusing. \n\nThe Story of Spin.  Thank you Michael Sommers for the recommendation. I haven't read it, but it seems good! Hard to find though.\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1349918.The_Story_of_Spin \n\nA Veritasium and Minute Physics video about electromagnetism! Thanks EnellGmz for reminding me about it. https://youtu.be/1TKSfAkWWN0\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\n\nTwitter:\n@Looking_glass_u\n\nFacebook\nwww.facebook.com/LookingGlassUniverse\n\nTumblr \nhttp://looking-glass-universe.tumblr.com/",

To make measurements, scientists must employ particle detectors. There are four big detectors at the LHC: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb.  In this video, Fermilab\u2019s Dr. Don Lincoln introduces us to these detectors and gives us an idea of each one\u2019s capabilities.\n\nRelated videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=debQ60QVtYQ\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6sKfPfYTU",

A theory is supersymmetric if it treats forces and matter on an equal footing.  While supersymmetry is an unproven idea, it is popular with particle physics researchers as a possible next step in particle physics.",

    "description": "From the BBC Radio 4 series about life's big questions - http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofideas\n\nThe existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre thought that human beings live in anguish. Not because life is terrible. But rather because, we\u2019re \u2018condemned to be free\u2019. We're \u2018thrown\u2019 into existence, become aware of ourselves, and have to make choices. Even deciding not to choose is a choice. According to Sartre, every choice reveals what we think a human being should be.\n\nNarrated by Stephen Fry. Scripted by Nigel Warburton. \n\nThis project is from the BBC in partnership with The Open University, the animations were created by Cognitive.",

The animated video about Bitcoin that was released today on http://bitcoinproperly.org is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the \u201ctrusted third party\u201d can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.\n\nFrom Bitcoin hype to Blockchain revolution: an internet of trust.\nWith the arrival of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, everyone around the world can trade with each other without any involvement from traditional third parties such as banks, notaries, accountants, and governments. Trade is a fundamental pillar of our economy and society, and traditional trusted parties play a crucial role in this.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin making all this possible \u2013 the Blockchain \u2013 ensures that the essential functions of the \u201ctrusted third party\u2019, are fully automatized through the internet. This way, these functions are as freely available, accessible, and programmable as the internet itself. \n\nThe animated video, available in both Dutch and English, explains how this works, also mentioning practical applications. The implications are clear: in the coming years, the role of the traditional trusted parties will inevitably and drastically change, strongly impacting our daily lives.\n\nThe creators of this animated video invite its viewers to think about and discuss the fundamental and radical innovations made possible by crypto currencies.\n\nRutger van Zuidam ecommerce entrepreneur and founder of IntoBitcoin.com: \u201cThe Netherlands have all the assets to become Europe\u2019s Silicon Valley of financial technology. It is possible for the Netherlands to position itself favourably in comparison to the US and UK, who are currently still ahead. The technology behind crypto currencies like Bitcoin plays an essential role in leveraging these opportunities. We hope that the animated video about the technology behind crypto currencies will positively affect this development.\u201d\n\nLykle de Vries: \u201dBitcoin is not the new money for internet,but it is the new internet for money, value and ownership in all forms.

    "description": "A short video explaining how a Bose-Einstein Condensate of sodium atoms is created in lab at MIT by Martin Zwierlein. Using highly focused, single frequency lasers it is possible to cool the single sodium atoms, negating their thermal vibrations by inducing electronic transitions which effectively \"pushes\" them into place. This brings the atoms down to millikelivn temperatures. \n\nHowever to achieve nanokelvin temperatures, magnetic fields are used to trap the atoms in a well or cup so that the atomic resonance of the atoms begins to match the frequency of the laser light so that , like in a cup of coffee or tea, the hottest atoms are boiled off the surface by \"blowing\" on the atoms with polarized laser light. This makes the atoms that are in resonance with the light move towards the center, leaving the hotter atoms to boil off. This then shrinks the gas cloud into a supercool sphere.\n\nThis arrangement is known as a magneto-optical trap and using it the atoms can be made colder than anywhere else in the universe, cold enough for the subtle effects of quantum mechanics to make the wavefunction of the atoms coherent, just like how a laser makes the photons in a laser medium coherent. The wavefunctions then constructively interfere until the atoms behave as a single quantum object known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a class of particles which have an integer quantum spin are called bosons. For example, photons, gluons, higgs boson etc. Any number of bosons can go to the same quantum state. Thus they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The wave function associated with bosons is symmetric.\n\nA class of particles which have a half- integer spin are called fermions. Example - proton, neutron, electron, etc. Unlike bosons, only two fermions (at maximum) can go to the same quantum state, as dictated by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. The wave function associated with fermions is anti-symmetric.\n\nAn atom can also be classified as a composite boson or a composite fermion.  To find whether an atom is a composite boson or a composite fermion, you need to look at the net spin of the atom due to its constituent particles that make it. For example, consider the simplest of the atoms - Hydrogen. Hydrogen has a proton and an electron. A proton is a half-integer particle and so is an electron. Therefore, the net spin of a normal hydrogen atom is one, which is an integer. Therefore, hydrogen is a composite boson. If we consider a helium-4 atom, there are two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Each of these particles has a half integer spin. Therefore, the net spin of a normal helium atom is an integer. Hence, helium is also a composite boson.\n\nWith Sodium, the number of protons is 11, the number of neutrons is 12, and therefore, the number nucleons is 23 which is an odd number. Since the number of electrons in Sodium atom is 11, this makes the total number of constituent particles 34 which is even and hence Sodium atom is a composite boson. \n\nSo by this reasoning, all Sodium-23 (as well as Rubidium-87) atoms are bosons which means that the spin of the atoms is an integer. Bosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics and do not obey the Pauli Exclusion prinipcle and can form non degenerate condensates. \n\nSo, because bosons tend to bunch together it is possible for a macroscopic group of N-bosons to form a giant wave function called a Bose-Einstein Condensate. \nTherefore, a Bose-Einstein Condensate is essentially a macroscopic occupation of the ground state of a quantum system at thermal equilibrium, and is considered to be a quantum phase transistion just like superfluidity and superconductivity. \n\nThis quantum state can be seen in wildly differing physical systems, from liquid helium to electron pairs in superconductors to the laser-cooled atoms in vacuum chambers as shown in the video.\nBose--Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of bosonic atoms and isotopes have been produced.\n\nRelated experiments in cooling fermions rather than bosons to extremely low temperatures have created degenerate gases, where the atoms do not congregate in a single state due to the Pauli exclusion principle. To exhibit Bose--Einstein condensation, the fermions must \"pair up\" to form compound particles (e.g. molecules or Cooper pairs) that are bosons. The first molecular Bose--Einstein condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of Rudolf Grimm at the University of Innsbruck, Deborah S. Jin at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT. Jin quickly went on to create the first fermionic condensate composed of Cooper pairs in a superconductor.",

Furthermore, it questions the role of the observer in the outcome of events and demonstrates the fundamental limitation of an observer to predict experimental results. \n\nFor this reason, Richard Feynman called it \"a phenomenon which is impossible ... to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics],\" (see more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment).\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://richannel.org/newsletter",

Sometimes, in an atomic tug-of-war, one atom pulls electrons from another, forming an ionic bond. Atoms can also play nicely and share electrons in a covalent bond. From simple oxygen to complex human chromosome 13, George Zaidan and Charles Morton break down the humble chemical bond. \n\nLesson by George Zaidan and Charles Morton, animation by Bevan Lynch.",

Here is an animation showing the architecture and catalytic function of ATP synthase. It sits in the inner membranes of the organelle, where it uses the trans-membrane proton motive force (pmf) generated by the oxidation of nutrients as a source of energy for making ATP. The pmf across the inner membrane of the organelle is coupled to the chemical synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate by a rotary mechanism. During ATP synthesis, the central rotor turns in the direction shown about 150 times every second. In order to provide energy to sustain our lives, every day, each one us produces a quantity of ATP by this mechanism that is approximately equal to our body weights.\n\nCredit: Mitochondrial Biology Unit (musical adaptation by Aditya Chopra)",

Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\n\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\n\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: http://bit.ly/1xSosoJ\nProf. John Preskill, Caltech: http://bit.ly/1y8mJut\n\nLooking Glass Universe: http://bit.ly/17zZH7l\nPhysics Girl: http://bit.ly/PhysGirl\nMinutePhysics: http://bit.ly/MinPhys\nCommunity Channel: http://bit.ly/CommChannel\nNigel, Helen, Luke, and Simon for comments on earlier drafts of this video.\n\nFilmed in part by Scott Lewis: http://google.com/+scottlewis\n\nMusic by Amarante \"One Last Time\": http://bit.ly/VeAmarante",

You'll learn why Adam Smith put such a high price on free markets, how Keynes found a bold new way to reduce unemployment, and what economists went on to discover about the impact of policy on people's and businesses' behaviour - which may not always be entirely rational.\n\nPlaylist link - http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQpDGfX5e7DDGEQvLonjDQsbclAF2N-t\n\n---\n\nStudy economics with the OU http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/social-sciences/economics/index.htm\n\n---",

    "description": "Peter Baumann, former member of the band Tangerine Dream and founder of the Baumann Foundation, argues that our baseline is a kind of joy of living, but that we're easily distracted from it. He explains the ancient Greek distinction between happiness in the moment and lasting, existential happiness, and the value of both.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/peter-baumann-on-happiness\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - The upwelling of positive feelings that we have when we are \u201chappy\u201d is also an evolutionary adaptation and it really signals that what we experience is beneficial for us. Something that really enhances our lives or protects us or gives us joy like a newborn or a new relationship or something like that. But if we were constantly happy we wouldn\u2019t see any threats that potentially are around the corner. So there is basically a positive and a negative wave that goes through our lives. Negative when we perceive things that are potentially threatening to us and positive when there are things that are really life enhancing. Having said that I believe that we have an underlying positive attitude towards life. We prefer to live than not to live. And again we have to have that. So the baseline is not zero where we have some days above zero and some days below zero.\n\nBut the baseline is positive in and of itself. In Greek they have two different words for happiness. One is hedonic and that\u2019s the typical pleasure of happiness, you know. The joyful like oh, this is wonderful and great. And then they have a word called eudaimonia and that is that positive baseline that simply is a joy of simply living.\n\nThere is so much happening in our lives that we pay attention to and quite frankly, you know, the little devices that we carry around don\u2019t help very much because our attention gets totally absorbed into that attraction from these little devices. And we get a little bit of dopamine all the time when we get information, information is valuable instinctively. So we want to know what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s true for gossip and it\u2019s true for why we watch the news. But the problem is that our attention is so much absorbed in that that we rarely, if ever, pay attention to just being present. And that is really what mindfulness and meditation is trying to balance out a little bit so that when the mind quiets and you actually are at home in your body that that distraction fades away and you actually get in touch with that underlying happiness that the Greeks call eudaimonia.\n\nJust to recognize I\u2019m alive. Just that simple fact is in and of itself positive. And that does not waver. That is always there. And that quality of happiness is there even when sad things happen, you know. So you cannot be always happy because if a loved one dies, you know, obviously you\u2019re not happy, you\u2019re sad. But within that you can have still the joy of living. So those are two different aspects of happiness that I think are very important to distinguish.",

    "description": "Stress can be your friend, says psychologist Kelly McGonigal. It's all a matter of how you respond to it.  Kelly McGonigal's latest book is \"The Upside of Stress\" (http://goo.gl/4QlqPu).\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/the-threat-and-challenge-response\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - Most people believe that there is one way that the body responds to stress, you know. Everyone\u2019s heard the fight-or-flight response. But it actually turns out that that\u2019s just one way that the body and brain can respond to a stressful circumstance. And it\u2019s often not a very helpful way to respond to a stressful circumstance, especially one in which you really want to rise to the challenge and perform your best where it\u2019s really not about survival mode. And it turns out that the brain and the body actually has another way of responding to these kind of high-stakes challenges, you know, whether it\u2019s an important negotiation or you have to give a speech or an athletic competition. Those moments where you really want to show up and do your best. And that other way of responding to stress is called a challenge response. That it\u2019s a way for your brain and body to give you maximum focus, attention, and energy. And it\u2019s physically different than the sort of the fight-or-flight response that we have when we feel- deeply threatened by a stressful situation. When you have a threat response, you know, your body and brain are shifting into the state that is really sort of the classic association with the harmful stress response.\n\nIt\u2019s going to make you more likely to choke under pressure. It\u2019s going to feel more like dread or overwhelm. When you have a challenge response, the brain and body actually sift into a state that gives you more access to your resources. You know your heart might still be pounding, but your blood vessels are going to relax and open up so you get more blood flow to your muscles and to your brain. Your brain shifts into a state \u2014 it\u2019s actually better at paying attention to everything in your environment rather than sort of being laser-focused like you might be in a fight-or-flight response on what\u2019s going wrong or what\u2019s dangerous. When you have a challenge response, all of your senses open to all the information that\u2019s available to you, which means that you\u2019re basically smarter under stress. And researchers have gotten really interested in figuring out how do you get people to shift from a threat response into a challenge response. Because unless your life is on the line in some sort of crazy emergency situation, it\u2019s going to be better for you to have a challenge response than a threat response. You\u2019ll perform better and that\u2019s been shown in situations ranging from people performing surgery to athletes on the field to students taking difficult exams. That when you have a challenge response, you just do better. And it seems like one of the best ways to shift from a threat response to a challenge response is actually to view your own stress response as a resource.\n\nYou know the reason that many people have a threat response in a stressful situation is that the very first signs if anxiety when they notice some sweat on their brow or they\u2019re starting to feel their heart pound they think, \"Uh oh, I\u2019m about to blow it,\" and they turn their attention to trying to calm down or trying to suppress whatever stress is arising. And research originally coming out of Harvard University has shown that when people say, \"Okay, I\u2019m stressed out. I feel stress happening right now. And that\u2019s a resource. That stress can actually help me do better.\" It actually changes the physiology of the stress response from threat to challenge and it helps people perform better whether they\u2019re giving a talk in public, whether they are engaging in a business negotiation, whether they\u2019re a student taking an exam \u2014 across many scenarios. Literally just embracing your own stress energy, arousal, or anxiety can transform what\u2019s happening in your brain and body to really help you rise to the challenge.",

    "description": "Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?\n\nThe experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.\n\nThe way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.\n\nSpecial thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.\n\nMusic by Kevin Mcleod (incompetech.com) Danse Macabre, Scissors",

Hank feels bad for our friend and wants us to learn more about it so that we can understand what it's trying to tell us - like that any bond between two atoms contains energy. How much energy? That's not the simplest question to answer, but today Hank will answer it (kinda), by teaching us about a nifty little thing called enthalpy.\n\nIf you are paying attention to this episode you'll learn what the state function is, and how it varies from a path-dependent function; why enthalpy change is different from heat; that bonds are energy and to form and break them they release and absorb heat to and from their environment. You'll get the quickest introduction to calorimetry ever (more on that in upcoming episodes) and learn the power of Hess's Law and how to use Germain Hess's concept of the standard enthalpy of formation to calculate exactly how much heat is produced by any chemical reaction. \n\nSo much to learn!

Join Gabe on this week\u2019s episode of PBS Space Time as he debunks popular black hole misconceptions, and rethinks what the term, \u2018black hole\u2019, even means.  Thought you knew what a black hole was?

Open clusters contain hundreds or thousands of stars held together by gravity. They\u2019re young, and evaporate over time, their stars let loose to roam space freely. Globular clusters, on the other hand, are larger, have hundreds of thousands of stars, and are more spherical. They\u2019re very old, a significant fraction of the age of the Universe itself, and that means their stars have less heavy elements in them, are redder, and probably don\u2019t have planets (though we\u2019re not really sure).\n\nCrash Course Astronomy Poster: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nOpen clusters contain hundreds or thousands of young stars 00:29\nOver time, open clusters evaporate 3:23\nGlobular clusters contain hundreds of thousands of old stars in spherical formation 5:50\nGlobular clusters have less heavy elements, thus probably do not have planets 6:43\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nMagellanic gemstone in the southern sky [NGC 290] http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0603c/ [credit: European Space Agency & NASA]\nExtreme star cluster bursts into life in new Hubble image http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0715a/ [credit: NASA, ESA and the Hubble Heritage (STScI/AURA)-ESA/Hubble Collaboration]\nView of a Sun-like star within an open cluster (artist\u2019s impression) http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1321d/ [credit: NASA, ESA, and M.

Stanley Miller simulated conditions thought be common on the ancient Earth. The purpose was to test the idea that the complex molecules of life (in this case, amino acids) could have arisen on our young planet through simple, natural chemical reactions.\n\nThe experiment was a success in that amino acids, the building blocks of life, were produced during the simulation. The finding was so significant that it kick started an entirely new field of study: Prebiotic Chemistry. \n\nScientists now have reason to believe that the gases used in the Miller-Urey simulation were not actually the same as those of the ancient atmosphere. Because of this, many experiments have since been done, testing a wide variety of atmospheres and different environmental conditions. The results are overwhelming: the molecules of life can form under a wide variety of ancient Earth-like conditions. \n\nMany questions about the origin of life remain to be answered but these findings give strong support to the idea that the first living cells on Earth may have emerged from natural chemical reactions.\n\nSources:\n\n\nThe Miller-Urey Experiment (actual paper from 1953):\nhttp://abenteuer-universum.de/pdf/miller_1953.pdf\n\nBiomolecules found in meteorites:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/life-components.html\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/dna-meteorites.html\n\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120001640.pdf\n\nBiomolecules form in asteroid simulations:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20358044\n\nBiomolecules form in Volcanic Simulations:\nhttp://astrobiology.gsfc.nasa.gov/analytical/PDF/Johnsonetal2008.pdf\n\nBiomolecules (amino acids) form in non-reducing atmosphere simulations: \nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-007-9120-3\n\nSealed chemical vials from some origional Miller experiments were recently re-examined with modern tools.

    "description": "About... how we can learn about the world, how to test hypothesis, and the basics of science. What is science? \nPreviously titled- \"How does do science?\"\n\nSIDE NOTES / OUTTAKES/ ADDITIONAL STUFF\nConcerning Universal Ideas\nIf the pen falls just once, then it has instantly falsified all other \u201cuniversal\u201d actions the pen could take. The pen can\u2019t always go up, we\u2019ve falsified that idea. So if there is a universal idea about the behaviour as the pen, can we deduce it as verified then maybe? \nMaybe, but we can\u2019t assume that this is a universal idea. If in space the pen wouldn\u2019t fall and this idea is untrue.\nHow about more simply :\u201dgravity will always work\u201d?\nBut I think we then have to verify the idea that\u2026 there are universal phenomena. Just because we\u2019ve never seen something go against these basic phenomena and the rules we build about them (I don\u2019t know of any documented examples to the counter of this). But this one truly is unfalsifiable idea I think.\n\nConcerning vague hypothesis\nThere are so many kinds of hypothesis. \u201cCarrots can shrink lumps\u201d. One kind of carrot shrinks all kinds of lumps? All kinds of carrots shrink one kind of lump?  \nWhy don\u2019t we take the hypothesis: \u201ccarrots shrink most lumps\u201d, or \u201ccarrots can shrink some lumps\u201d? \nIt\u2019s because these are very vague visions of the world. We can shift how we think about our data to either verify or falsify them. And if we do verify or falsify them, really what have we learned? Like with horoscopes. I pulled this out of the Globe and Mail: \n\u201cSome people have been rather critical of you in recent weeks but over the next few days you will be able to show that you were right and they were wrong. They won\u2019t thank you for it, of course, but you will be smiling.\u201d\nSo if anybody said anything wrong about you, even a little, the first idea is verified in your mind. And the second part as long as you feel like you\u2019re right at some point in the next few days, even a little, that part of the horoscope is verified in your mind. And your mind may further justify it like, \u201cmaybe it happened and I missed it\u201d.\nAlthough we do it day to day because it could be useful. If rain sometimes comes after thunder then we just put away horse meat regardless and we\u2019ll be doing ok.\nHow about the hypothesis that carrots shrink 90% of lump? \nThis is more concrete. Kind of like hypothesizing that a dice will role a five 1/6th of the time. \nBut it\u2019s different in the case with lump, because we don\u2019t know what the \u201cdice\u201d look like. \u201cCarrots only shrink 90% of lumps\u201d without observational basis for it is a strange hypothesis. Maybe if we consistently see carrots only shrinking 90% of lumps we could hold that an observation and investigate. \nWith actual dice, there is observational basis to hold the idea.\n\nConcerning quantum physics\nQuantum physics may be a world where detecting the thing, changes what is observed on a fundamental level. Not just an interfering detection method like\u2026 trying to detect the position of a bus by throwing buses at it. It\u2019s apparently a much more fundamental observation quirk. \nBut it is so in predictable and repeatable ways. The fact that observing, affects what we see\u2026 would just be the observation in this case. The apparent effect of the observation is the observation. \n\u2026..although maybe I just don\u2019t understand quantum physics. \n \nConcerning Objective Truth\nThe brain in a vat thought experiment I think is meant to make us think that there may be no objective truth. You know, don't even assume what you see is the same as what others see. I really hesitated to ever show the outside world (with the white background) and wanted the \"truth\" or \"facts\" to always be in the golden circles as a construct in the mind. But I did show the outside world because I feel like it's how we think about the world. I think you could go your whole life never thinking about how the world is only experienced by your brain, never thinking about whether your experiences are genuine or the same as other people, and still come out fine. And what's the alternative? Making reality whatever you want? We can go ride a walrus to an ice cream tree.\n\nConcerning other kinds of \u201cbrain pictures\u201d\nThere\u2019s other concepts and thoughts and ideas we can have like fantasy and fiction. And other sentences we can build like questions or commands. Not just statements and ideas about the way the world is.\n Our brains also do more than look at and build concepts of the world. Like make us move around and eat spray cheese.\n\nPatreon https://patreon.com/user?u=849925",

We also had plenty of bad ideas about how to prevent it, like bloodletting, large holes in the head and drinking arsenic.\n\nThings started changing only about 200 years ago. An English doctor named Edward Jenner decided to take a closer look at a promising folk remedy. (We'll leave the details for the video.) Eventually, he invented vaccination, our first safe and effective way to fight disease. About time!\n\nSo what did that do for us? Consider that in 1900, the average person lived only about 30 years. Today, most of us live to seventy. We were so successful in such a short time, the U.S. Surgeon General reportedly exclaimed in 1967 that we had closed the book on infectious disease.\n\nIf only!

    "description": "Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of the agricultural revolution, many of our deadly human diseases didn't exist. What changed?\n\nFor the first time in history, humans were living in close contact with domesticated animals - milking them, taking care of them, living with them and eating them. All that touching and sharing gave animal germs plenty of chances to get inside of us.\n\nTake measles. Researchers think that up until about 5,000 years ago, it didn\u2019t exist. But its older cousin Rinderpest, a cattle disease, did. Now that humans were spending so much quality time with cows, little Rinderpest germs started jumping over into us. And a few of them had a lucky mutation that allowed Rinderpest to evolve from a cattle disease into measles, a deadly human virus.\n\nBut our ancestors had no idea what the problem was - or how to fix it. See how humans finally get a clue, in  Episode 3, coming Feb. 16.\n\nWatch Episode 1: A Short History of Humans and Germs: Early Encounters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utcn6LGYHSI\nAnd see what new viruses are emerging in your backyard: http://n.pr/2lr8mRf\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to NPR on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/npr\n\nFollow NPR elsewhere, too:\n\u2022 Twitter: https://twitter.com/npr\n\u2022 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NPR\n\u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/npr/\n\u2022 Tumblr: http://npr.tumblr.com/\n\u2022 Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/npr\n\nABOUT NPR\nNPR connects to audiences on the air, on demand, online, and in person.

So today, we\u2019re going to take a look at computing\u2019s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we\u2019ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps://about.me/carrieannephilbin\n\nWant more Crash Course in person?

Well, evidence suggests that there was indeed a starting point to this universe we are part of right now. But how can this be? How can something come from nothing? And what about time? We don't have all the answers yet so let's talk about what we know.\n\nAlso, we try to make this one not depressing. Tell us if we succeeded. \n\nwww.Kurzgesagt.org\n\nBY THE WAY. We have a website now. We'll try to blog from time to time, show you guys how we make the videos and give more insight to our process. Also we sell stuff.

The animated video about Bitcoin that was released today on http://bitcoinproperly.org is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the \u201ctrusted third party\u201d can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.\n\nFrom Bitcoin hype to Blockchain revolution: an internet of trust.\nWith the arrival of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, everyone around the world can trade with each other without any involvement from traditional third parties such as banks, notaries, accountants, and governments. Trade is a fundamental pillar of our economy and society, and traditional trusted parties play a crucial role in this.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin making all this possible \u2013 the Blockchain \u2013 ensures that the essential functions of the \u201ctrusted third party\u2019, are fully automatized through the internet. This way, these functions are as freely available, accessible, and programmable as the internet itself. \n\nThe animated video, available in both Dutch and English, explains how this works, also mentioning practical applications. The implications are clear: in the coming years, the role of the traditional trusted parties will inevitably and drastically change, strongly impacting our daily lives.\n\nThe creators of this animated video invite its viewers to think about and discuss the fundamental and radical innovations made possible by crypto currencies.\n\nRutger van Zuidam ecommerce entrepreneur and founder of IntoBitcoin.com: \u201cThe Netherlands have all the assets to become Europe\u2019s Silicon Valley of financial technology. It is possible for the Netherlands to position itself favourably in comparison to the US and UK, who are currently still ahead. The technology behind crypto currencies like Bitcoin plays an essential role in leveraging these opportunities. We hope that the animated video about the technology behind crypto currencies will positively affect this development.\u201d\n\nLykle de Vries: \u201dBitcoin is not the new money for internet,but it is the new internet for money, value and ownership in all forms. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are the next step in the emancipation of all world citizens, and can help create a new dynamic for democracy, society and economy.\u201d\n\nAbout the creators\nThe animated video is a non-profit initiative by designers Patrick Loonstra (www.patrickloonstra.nl) and Sebas van den Brink (sebasvandenbrink.nl) and entrepreneurs Lykle de Vries (ThesisOne.com) and Rutger van Zuidam (Senanga.net, IntoBitcoin.com).",

    "description": "A short video explaining how a Bose-Einstein Condensate of sodium atoms is created in lab at MIT by Martin Zwierlein. Using highly focused, single frequency lasers it is possible to cool the single sodium atoms, negating their thermal vibrations by inducing electronic transitions which effectively \"pushes\" them into place. This brings the atoms down to millikelivn temperatures. \n\nHowever to achieve nanokelvin temperatures, magnetic fields are used to trap the atoms in a well or cup so that the atomic resonance of the atoms begins to match the frequency of the laser light so that , like in a cup of coffee or tea, the hottest atoms are boiled off the surface by \"blowing\" on the atoms with polarized laser light. This makes the atoms that are in resonance with the light move towards the center, leaving the hotter atoms to boil off. This then shrinks the gas cloud into a supercool sphere.\n\nThis arrangement is known as a magneto-optical trap and using it the atoms can be made colder than anywhere else in the universe, cold enough for the subtle effects of quantum mechanics to make the wavefunction of the atoms coherent, just like how a laser makes the photons in a laser medium coherent. The wavefunctions then constructively interfere until the atoms behave as a single quantum object known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a class of particles which have an integer quantum spin are called bosons. For example, photons, gluons, higgs boson etc. Any number of bosons can go to the same quantum state. Thus they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The wave function associated with bosons is symmetric.\n\nA class of particles which have a half- integer spin are called fermions. Example - proton, neutron, electron, etc. Unlike bosons, only two fermions (at maximum) can go to the same quantum state, as dictated by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. The wave function associated with fermions is anti-symmetric.\n\nAn atom can also be classified as a composite boson or a composite fermion.  To find whether an atom is a composite boson or a composite fermion, you need to look at the net spin of the atom due to its constituent particles that make it. For example, consider the simplest of the atoms - Hydrogen. Hydrogen has a proton and an electron. A proton is a half-integer particle and so is an electron. Therefore, the net spin of a normal hydrogen atom is one, which is an integer. Therefore, hydrogen is a composite boson. If we consider a helium-4 atom, there are two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Each of these particles has a half integer spin. Therefore, the net spin of a normal helium atom is an integer. Hence, helium is also a composite boson.\n\nWith Sodium, the number of protons is 11, the number of neutrons is 12, and therefore, the number nucleons is 23 which is an odd number. Since the number of electrons in Sodium atom is 11, this makes the total number of constituent particles 34 which is even and hence Sodium atom is a composite boson. \n\nSo by this reasoning, all Sodium-23 (as well as Rubidium-87) atoms are bosons which means that the spin of the atoms is an integer. Bosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics and do not obey the Pauli Exclusion prinipcle and can form non degenerate condensates. \n\nSo, because bosons tend to bunch together it is possible for a macroscopic group of N-bosons to form a giant wave function called a Bose-Einstein Condensate. \nTherefore, a Bose-Einstein Condensate is essentially a macroscopic occupation of the ground state of a quantum system at thermal equilibrium, and is considered to be a quantum phase transistion just like superfluidity and superconductivity. \n\nThis quantum state can be seen in wildly differing physical systems, from liquid helium to electron pairs in superconductors to the laser-cooled atoms in vacuum chambers as shown in the video.\nBose--Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of bosonic atoms and isotopes have been produced.\n\nRelated experiments in cooling fermions rather than bosons to extremely low temperatures have created degenerate gases, where the atoms do not congregate in a single state due to the Pauli exclusion principle. To exhibit Bose--Einstein condensation, the fermions must \"pair up\" to form compound particles (e.g. molecules or Cooper pairs) that are bosons. The first molecular Bose--Einstein condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of Rudolf Grimm at the University of Innsbruck, Deborah S. Jin at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT. Jin quickly went on to create the first fermionic condensate composed of Cooper pairs in a superconductor.",

It\u2019s your liver: the heaviest organ in your body, which simultaneously acts as a storehouse, a manufacturing hub, and a processing plant. Emma Bryce gives a crash course on the liver and how it helps keep us alive.\n\nLesson by Emma Bryce, animation by Andrew Zimbelman for The Foreign Correspondents' Club.",

And for 40 percent of the world, cheap, plentiful coal gets the job done. But coal also releases pollutants into the air, causing environmental damage like acid rain and serious health problems. Can we create a cleaner version of coal? Emma Bryce details the three ways we might strip coal of its foul forces.\n\nLesson by Emma Bryce, animation by Artrake Studio.",

Furthermore, it questions the role of the observer in the outcome of events and demonstrates the fundamental limitation of an observer to predict experimental results. \n\nFor this reason, Richard Feynman called it \"a phenomenon which is impossible ... to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics],\" (see more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment).\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://richannel.org/newsletter",

And why does it all disappear so quickly after payday? John will look into 75% of these questions, and if he doesn't come up with answers, we'll get into some interesting ideas along the way, at least. This week we'll investigate whether money displaces barter, then leads to war, slavery, and what we think of as civilized social orders. We'll also see what old Adam Smith thinks of big money, no whammies, this week on Crash Course.\n\nWe'll also talk quite a bit about Debt: The First 5000 Years by David Graeber. You can buy that book here: http://dft.ba/-debt5000\n\nYou can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

    "description": "John Walker shared his Nobel Prize with the Paul Boyer for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Here is an animation showing the architecture and catalytic function of ATP synthase. It sits in the inner membranes of the organelle, where it uses the trans-membrane proton motive force (pmf) generated by the oxidation of nutrients as a source of energy for making ATP. The pmf across the inner membrane of the organelle is coupled to the chemical synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate by a rotary mechanism. During ATP synthesis, the central rotor turns in the direction shown about 150 times every second. In order to provide energy to sustain our lives, every day, each one us produces a quantity of ATP by this mechanism that is approximately equal to our body weights.\n\nCredit: Mitochondrial Biology Unit (musical adaptation by Aditya Chopra)",

    "description": "Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?\nWhat is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe\nFirst, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\n\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\n\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: http://bit.ly/1xSosoJ\nProf. John Preskill, Caltech: http://bit.ly/1y8mJut\n\nLooking Glass Universe: http://bit.ly/17zZH7l\nPhysics Girl: http://bit.ly/PhysGirl\nMinutePhysics: http://bit.ly/MinPhys\nCommunity Channel: http://bit.ly/CommChannel\nNigel, Helen, Luke, and Simon for comments on earlier drafts of this video.\n\nFilmed in part by Scott Lewis: http://google.com/+scottlewis\n\nMusic by Amarante \"One Last Time\": http://bit.ly/VeAmarante",

    "description": "Peter Baumann, former member of the band Tangerine Dream and founder of the Baumann Foundation, argues that our baseline is a kind of joy of living, but that we're easily distracted from it. He explains the ancient Greek distinction between happiness in the moment and lasting, existential happiness, and the value of both.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/peter-baumann-on-happiness\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - The upwelling of positive feelings that we have when we are \u201chappy\u201d is also an evolutionary adaptation and it really signals that what we experience is beneficial for us. Something that really enhances our lives or protects us or gives us joy like a newborn or a new relationship or something like that. But if we were constantly happy we wouldn\u2019t see any threats that potentially are around the corner. So there is basically a positive and a negative wave that goes through our lives. Negative when we perceive things that are potentially threatening to us and positive when there are things that are really life enhancing. Having said that I believe that we have an underlying positive attitude towards life. We prefer to live than not to live. And again we have to have that. So the baseline is not zero where we have some days above zero and some days below zero.\n\nBut the baseline is positive in and of itself. In Greek they have two different words for happiness. One is hedonic and that\u2019s the typical pleasure of happiness, you know. The joyful like oh, this is wonderful and great. And then they have a word called eudaimonia and that is that positive baseline that simply is a joy of simply living.\n\nThere is so much happening in our lives that we pay attention to and quite frankly, you know, the little devices that we carry around don\u2019t help very much because our attention gets totally absorbed into that attraction from these little devices. And we get a little bit of dopamine all the time when we get information, information is valuable instinctively. So we want to know what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s true for gossip and it\u2019s true for why we watch the news. But the problem is that our attention is so much absorbed in that that we rarely, if ever, pay attention to just being present. And that is really what mindfulness and meditation is trying to balance out a little bit so that when the mind quiets and you actually are at home in your body that that distraction fades away and you actually get in touch with that underlying happiness that the Greeks call eudaimonia.\n\nJust to recognize I\u2019m alive. Just that simple fact is in and of itself positive. And that does not waver. That is always there. And that quality of happiness is there even when sad things happen, you know. So you cannot be always happy because if a loved one dies, you know, obviously you\u2019re not happy, you\u2019re sad. But within that you can have still the joy of living. So those are two different aspects of happiness that I think are very important to distinguish.",

Actually, not how some of our common evolutionary metaphors would have us believe. For instance, it's species, not individual organisms, that adapt to produce evolution, and genes don't \"want\" to be passed on -- a gene can't want anything at all! Alex Gendler sets the record straight on the finer points of evolution. \n\nLesson by Alex Gendler, animation by Giant Animation Studios.",

The origin of life needs its own explanation.\n\nScientists don't currently have a complete explanation for life's origins, but different labs around the globe are looking into the idea that life may have emerged from chemistry. In this animation you will learn why they are studying this idea, and you'll get to see a few of the fascinating things they have discovered.\n\nHere are some links for further learning (organized by topic):\n\nOVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH\n\nHere David Deamer gives a wonderful overview of our current understanding of the origin of life.

This video explores the evolution of early organisms but does not go over the origin of the first living things.  \nhttp://youtu.be/leLpFwjjn8M\n\n\nMETABOLIC PATHWAYS\n\nThis research explores a primitive metabolic pathway which could have easily formed through chemical evolution on the ancient earth (you need a subscription to the journal to get past the abstract) http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-006-9059-9\n\n\nWebsites for further learning:\n\nThis Interactive website outlines many of the discoveries made by life origin researchers. http://exploringorigins.org/\n\nThis website explains the research goals and findings of the Center for Chemical Evolution at Georgia Tech: http://centerforchemicalevolution.com/",

    "description": "Stress can be your friend, says psychologist Kelly McGonigal. It's all a matter of how you respond to it.  Kelly McGonigal's latest book is \"The Upside of Stress\" (http://goo.gl/4QlqPu).\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/the-threat-and-challenge-response\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - Most people believe that there is one way that the body responds to stress, you know. Everyone\u2019s heard the fight-or-flight response. But it actually turns out that that\u2019s just one way that the body and brain can respond to a stressful circumstance. And it\u2019s often not a very helpful way to respond to a stressful circumstance, especially one in which you really want to rise to the challenge and perform your best where it\u2019s really not about survival mode. And it turns out that the brain and the body actually has another way of responding to these kind of high-stakes challenges, you know, whether it\u2019s an important negotiation or you have to give a speech or an athletic competition. Those moments where you really want to show up and do your best. And that other way of responding to stress is called a challenge response. That it\u2019s a way for your brain and body to give you maximum focus, attention, and energy. And it\u2019s physically different than the sort of the fight-or-flight response that we have when we feel- deeply threatened by a stressful situation. When you have a threat response, you know, your body and brain are shifting into the state that is really sort of the classic association with the harmful stress response.\n\nIt\u2019s going to make you more likely to choke under pressure. It\u2019s going to feel more like dread or overwhelm. When you have a challenge response, the brain and body actually sift into a state that gives you more access to your resources. You know your heart might still be pounding, but your blood vessels are going to relax and open up so you get more blood flow to your muscles and to your brain. Your brain shifts into a state \u2014 it\u2019s actually better at paying attention to everything in your environment rather than sort of being laser-focused like you might be in a fight-or-flight response on what\u2019s going wrong or what\u2019s dangerous. When you have a challenge response, all of your senses open to all the information that\u2019s available to you, which means that you\u2019re basically smarter under stress. And researchers have gotten really interested in figuring out how do you get people to shift from a threat response into a challenge response. Because unless your life is on the line in some sort of crazy emergency situation, it\u2019s going to be better for you to have a challenge response than a threat response. You\u2019ll perform better and that\u2019s been shown in situations ranging from people performing surgery to athletes on the field to students taking difficult exams. That when you have a challenge response, you just do better. And it seems like one of the best ways to shift from a threat response to a challenge response is actually to view your own stress response as a resource.\n\nYou know the reason that many people have a threat response in a stressful situation is that the very first signs if anxiety when they notice some sweat on their brow or they\u2019re starting to feel their heart pound they think, \"Uh oh, I\u2019m about to blow it,\" and they turn their attention to trying to calm down or trying to suppress whatever stress is arising. And research originally coming out of Harvard University has shown that when people say, \"Okay, I\u2019m stressed out. I feel stress happening right now. And that\u2019s a resource. That stress can actually help me do better.\" It actually changes the physiology of the stress response from threat to challenge and it helps people perform better whether they\u2019re giving a talk in public, whether they are engaging in a business negotiation, whether they\u2019re a student taking an exam \u2014 across many scenarios. Literally just embracing your own stress energy, arousal, or anxiety can transform what\u2019s happening in your brain and body to really help you rise to the challenge.",

    "description": "Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?\n\nThe experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.\n\nThe way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.\n\nSpecial thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.\n\nMusic by Kevin Mcleod (incompetech.com) Danse Macabre, Scissors",

Hank feels bad for our friend and wants us to learn more about it so that we can understand what it's trying to tell us - like that any bond between two atoms contains energy. How much energy? That's not the simplest question to answer, but today Hank will answer it (kinda), by teaching us about a nifty little thing called enthalpy.\n\nIf you are paying attention to this episode you'll learn what the state function is, and how it varies from a path-dependent function; why enthalpy change is different from heat; that bonds are energy and to form and break them they release and absorb heat to and from their environment. You'll get the quickest introduction to calorimetry ever (more on that in upcoming episodes) and learn the power of Hess's Law and how to use Germain Hess's concept of the standard enthalpy of formation to calculate exactly how much heat is produced by any chemical reaction. \n\nSo much to learn! Let's get started! \n\n--\nTable of Contents\nState Function 1:50\nPath-Dependent Function 1:15\nEnthalpy 2:58\nBonds are Energy 5:10\nColorimetry 5:36\nHess' Law 6:19\nStandard Enthalpy of Formation 7:24\n\n--\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com Support CrashCourse on Subbable: http://subbable.com/crashcourse",

Neutrons stars are incredibly dense, spin rapidly, and have very strong magnetic fields. Some of them we see as pulsars, flashing in brightness as they spin. Neutrons stars with the strongest magnetic fields are called magnetars, and are capable of colossal bursts of energy that can be detected over vast distances.\n\nCrash Course Astronomy Poster: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nA Star Can Collapse to Form a Neutron Star 0:59\nNeutron Star Characteristics 2:24\nPulsars 5:56\nMagnetars 8:15\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nStar Burst https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=11447 [credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center]\nX-ray Images of G292.0+1.8 http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/animations/snr.html/?page=8 [credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/Penn State/S.Park et al.; Optical: Pal.Obs.

Open clusters contain hundreds or thousands of stars held together by gravity. They\u2019re young, and evaporate over time, their stars let loose to roam space freely. Globular clusters, on the other hand, are larger, have hundreds of thousands of stars, and are more spherical. They\u2019re very old, a significant fraction of the age of the Universe itself, and that means their stars have less heavy elements in them, are redder, and probably don\u2019t have planets (though we\u2019re not really sure).\n\nCrash Course Astronomy Poster: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\n\nTable of Contents\nOpen clusters contain hundreds or thousands of young stars 00:29\nOver time, open clusters evaporate 3:23\nGlobular clusters contain hundreds of thousands of old stars in spherical formation 5:50\nGlobular clusters have less heavy elements, thus probably do not have planets 6:43\n\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nMagellanic gemstone in the southern sky [NGC 290] http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0603c/ [credit: European Space Agency & NASA]\nExtreme star cluster bursts into life in new Hubble image http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0715a/ [credit: NASA, ESA and the Hubble Heritage (STScI/AURA)-ESA/Hubble Collaboration]\nView of a Sun-like star within an open cluster (artist\u2019s impression) http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1321d/ [credit: NASA, ESA, and M.

Stanley Miller simulated conditions thought be common on the ancient Earth. The purpose was to test the idea that the complex molecules of life (in this case, amino acids) could have arisen on our young planet through simple, natural chemical reactions.\n\nThe experiment was a success in that amino acids, the building blocks of life, were produced during the simulation. The finding was so significant that it kick started an entirely new field of study: Prebiotic Chemistry. \n\nScientists now have reason to believe that the gases used in the Miller-Urey simulation were not actually the same as those of the ancient atmosphere. Because of this, many experiments have since been done, testing a wide variety of atmospheres and different environmental conditions. The results are overwhelming: the molecules of life can form under a wide variety of ancient Earth-like conditions. \n\nMany questions about the origin of life remain to be answered but these findings give strong support to the idea that the first living cells on Earth may have emerged from natural chemical reactions.\n\nSources:\n\n\nThe Miller-Urey Experiment (actual paper from 1953):\nhttp://abenteuer-universum.de/pdf/miller_1953.pdf\n\nBiomolecules found in meteorites:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/life-components.html\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/dna-meteorites.html\n\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120001640.pdf\n\nBiomolecules form in asteroid simulations:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20358044\n\nBiomolecules form in Volcanic Simulations:\nhttp://astrobiology.gsfc.nasa.gov/analytical/PDF/Johnsonetal2008.pdf\n\nBiomolecules (amino acids) form in non-reducing atmosphere simulations: \nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-007-9120-3\n\nSealed chemical vials from some origional Miller experiments were recently re-examined with modern tools.

    "description": "About... how we can learn about the world, how to test hypothesis, and the basics of science. What is science? \nPreviously titled- \"How does do science?\"\n\nSIDE NOTES / OUTTAKES/ ADDITIONAL STUFF\nConcerning Universal Ideas\nIf the pen falls just once, then it has instantly falsified all other \u201cuniversal\u201d actions the pen could take. The pen can\u2019t always go up, we\u2019ve falsified that idea. So if there is a universal idea about the behaviour as the pen, can we deduce it as verified then maybe? \nMaybe, but we can\u2019t assume that this is a universal idea. If in space the pen wouldn\u2019t fall and this idea is untrue.\nHow about more simply :\u201dgravity will always work\u201d?\nBut I think we then have to verify the idea that\u2026 there are universal phenomena. Just because we\u2019ve never seen something go against these basic phenomena and the rules we build about them (I don\u2019t know of any documented examples to the counter of this). But this one truly is unfalsifiable idea I think.\n\nConcerning vague hypothesis\nThere are so many kinds of hypothesis. \u201cCarrots can shrink lumps\u201d. One kind of carrot shrinks all kinds of lumps? All kinds of carrots shrink one kind of lump?  \nWhy don\u2019t we take the hypothesis: \u201ccarrots shrink most lumps\u201d, or \u201ccarrots can shrink some lumps\u201d? \nIt\u2019s because these are very vague visions of the world. We can shift how we think about our data to either verify or falsify them. And if we do verify or falsify them, really what have we learned? Like with horoscopes. I pulled this out of the Globe and Mail: \n\u201cSome people have been rather critical of you in recent weeks but over the next few days you will be able to show that you were right and they were wrong. They won\u2019t thank you for it, of course, but you will be smiling.\u201d\nSo if anybody said anything wrong about you, even a little, the first idea is verified in your mind. And the second part as long as you feel like you\u2019re right at some point in the next few days, even a little, that part of the horoscope is verified in your mind. And your mind may further justify it like, \u201cmaybe it happened and I missed it\u201d.\nAlthough we do it day to day because it could be useful. If rain sometimes comes after thunder then we just put away horse meat regardless and we\u2019ll be doing ok.\nHow about the hypothesis that carrots shrink 90% of lump? \nThis is more concrete. Kind of like hypothesizing that a dice will role a five 1/6th of the time. \nBut it\u2019s different in the case with lump, because we don\u2019t know what the \u201cdice\u201d look like. \u201cCarrots only shrink 90% of lumps\u201d without observational basis for it is a strange hypothesis. Maybe if we consistently see carrots only shrinking 90% of lumps we could hold that an observation and investigate. \nWith actual dice, there is observational basis to hold the idea.\n\nConcerning quantum physics\nQuantum physics may be a world where detecting the thing, changes what is observed on a fundamental level. Not just an interfering detection method like\u2026 trying to detect the position of a bus by throwing buses at it. It\u2019s apparently a much more fundamental observation quirk. \nBut it is so in predictable and repeatable ways. The fact that observing, affects what we see\u2026 would just be the observation in this case. The apparent effect of the observation is the observation. \n\u2026..although maybe I just don\u2019t understand quantum physics. \n \nConcerning Objective Truth\nThe brain in a vat thought experiment I think is meant to make us think that there may be no objective truth. You know, don't even assume what you see is the same as what others see. I really hesitated to ever show the outside world (with the white background) and wanted the \"truth\" or \"facts\" to always be in the golden circles as a construct in the mind. But I did show the outside world because I feel like it's how we think about the world. I think you could go your whole life never thinking about how the world is only experienced by your brain, never thinking about whether your experiences are genuine or the same as other people, and still come out fine. And what's the alternative? Making reality whatever you want? We can go ride a walrus to an ice cream tree.\n\nConcerning other kinds of \u201cbrain pictures\u201d\nThere\u2019s other concepts and thoughts and ideas we can have like fantasy and fiction. And other sentences we can build like questions or commands. Not just statements and ideas about the way the world is.\n Our brains also do more than look at and build concepts of the world. Like make us move around and eat spray cheese.\n\nPatreon https://patreon.com/user?u=849925",

    "description": "Award-winning* demonstration of gravity, featuring the \"Spacetime Stretcher,\"  built mostly out of materials from my garage and the hardware store. Please support me on Patreon! Thank you! http://www.patreon.com/edwardcurrent\n\nMore info:\n\n1. As a falling object's path goes increasingly in the space (down) direction, it goes a little bit less in the time direction. Gravity is effectively converting some of its travel through time into travel through space. How much time converts into how much space? It works out to be 186,000 miles of space for every second of time -- that's the speed of light! The equivalence between a little time and a lot of space has a parallel with Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2, where a little mass is equivalent to a lot of energy -- also with the speed of light c as the conversion factor, only squared. It's amazing how all these physics concepts fit together.\n\n2. An object moving up or down at the speed of light, such as a photon, follows a vertical path on our graph. If we could warp the Spacetime Stretcher as much as we wanted, we could make the time axis curve around and re-intersect with this vertical line. That would be a black hole: Even a photon moving straight up would get \"warped back\" to the place where it started.\n\n3. Spacetime warping is usually depicted as going into a higher dimension -- in this case, bending toward or away from the camera. But such a device would have been much harder to build. You can think of this model as a two-dimensional \"projection\" or \"shadow\" of three-dimensional curvature, i.e. the flattening of a flared-out surface that curls away from the plane of the graph.\n\n4. In addition to mechanically calculating trajectories of objects falling on the Earth, Mars, or Moon, the Spacetime Stretcher (at a zoomed-out calibration scale) can also calculate the length-contraction and time-dilation observed with a rocket traveling close to the speed of light.\n* http://fqxi.org/community/contest/video/winners/2014.1",

We look forward to a brighter future for drug use.  If you like our films, take a look at our shop (we ship worldwide):  https://goo.gl/AcvyK6   \n\nFURTHER READING\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to have a pretty negative view of drugs: the news is always going on about police raids on drug dealers, kids tripping dangerously at raves, overdoses and rehab.\nIt goes without saying: things can go horrifically wrong around drugs. But our intense awareness of the negatives is in danger of creating a misleadingly narrow view of the subject. Drugs are \u2013 at best \u2013 serious, dignified, noble and important, and we need more of them in our lives....\u201d\nYou can read more on this and many other topics on our blog TheBookofLife.org: https://goo.gl/PQlio4 \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/j6QPBm \n\nMore films on SELF in our playlist below: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself \n\nDo you speak a different language to English?

Soon they'll know for sure.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nThe biggest problem with trying to detect a black hole is that even the supermassive ones are relatively tiny.\n\n\"The largest one in the sky [is] the black hole in the center of the Milky Way,\" Dimitrios Psaltis, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, writes me in an email. \"And taking a picture of it would be equivalent to taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon.\"\n\nWhat's more, because of their strong gravity, black holes tend to be surrounded by other bright matter that makes it hard to see the object itself.\n\nThat's why, when hunting for black holes, astronomers don't usually try for direct observation. Instead, they look for evidence of the effects of a black hole's gravity and radiation.\n\nBut an ongoing effort is linking up several radio telescopes around the world in an effort to see a black hole up close for the first time. The historic image is due in 2017. \n\nRead more: http://www.vox.com/2016/2/23/11095624/what-does-a-black-hole-actually-look-like\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

This telescope took star sightings which were used to align the Module's guidance system. Bill shows how the telescope used an Archimedes spiral inscribed on its eyepiece to replace the heavy motors, worm gears, and rigid tracks used in a traditional sextant -- this shaved weight from the Lunar Module and allowed it to carry more fuel.\n\nYou can bundle watch Bill's videos using this playlist: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0INsTTU1k2UO-2-AwomFmAs4nuZU9ht3\n\nIf you are interested in mechanical computers you'll likely enjoy his series on Albert Michelson's Harmonic Analyzer -- a 19th century machine that calculates Fourier transforms:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0INsTTU1k2UYO9Mck-i5HNqGNW5AeEwq",

    "description": "Betrayal is part of giving trust, says JetBlue Chairman Joel Peterson. So the odds are you will be betrayed at some point in time. Still, recovery and healing are possible.  Peterson's book is \"The 10 Laws of Trust:  Building the Bonds That Make a Business Great\" (http://goo.gl/oIG94o).\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/joel-peterson-on-coping-with-betrayal\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - So betrayal is a very tough thing and it\u2019s part of giving trust is the odds are you will be betrayed at some point in time. So getting good at dealing with betrayal is a really important thing. And I think it starts with realizing that you have joint ventured the betrayal. You\u2019ve had a part to do with it. It could be that you trusted when you shouldn\u2019t have trusted. You didn\u2019t think about whether the person had high character, was competent and had the authority and therefore shame on you. We don\u2019t like to take responsibility for that but I think if you step back and say how did I participate in this? I think that gives you insight and sort of the first ability to start approaching it in a way that allows you to heal. Because that\u2019s really what you want to do in a betrayal is you want to heal as fast as you can. And so I think it really helps to do that. \n\nSo any time you\u2019re betrayed you feel alone. You feel like why me? You have the poor me\u2019s and you feel like you\u2019ve been attacked and it\u2019s all unfair and everything. I think if you step back and say everybody\u2019s been betrayed, everybody knows what this feels like and people get over it. And therefore I\u2019m not alone in this and I can learn from other people and this too will pass. So sometimes when you\u2019re in the midst of it and you\u2019re dealing with it and it\u2019s acute it feels like it\u2019s all you can think about. You wake up in the middle of the night it\u2019s the first thing on your mind. When you start your day it stays with you throughout the day and you start to marinate in it. And I think it\u2019s really helpful to step back and say this has happened to other people before and therefore I will get through this.\n\nSo sometimes people betray us and it\u2019s not that serious. They didn\u2019t deliver a project on time or on budget or they didn\u2019t get the report done right or they didn\u2019t double check their spelling. There are all kinds of levels of betrayal. And some of them really are just fumbles, stumbles, poor judgment or whatever. Others are really very serious where somebody has cheated you or told a lie or spread gossip or something like that. So I think you have to sort of calibrate what is the nature of this betrayal. lIf it is one of the former I think you can step in and say we need to come to an understanding so this doesn\u2019t happen again. Many times it\u2019s really just a question of having clarity around things and the betrayal is overcome. If it is something more serious than that it may take a whole lot more work and that work may not be worth it. In many cases it is not worth it. Certain kinds of betrayal are just not worth fixing.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve been betrayed there are, sometimes there are elements, for example, if it\u2019s just bad information or you can fix it quickly. If it\u2019s early on in somebody\u2019s career fix it quickly. Don\u2019t let the betrayal fester. Don\u2019t allow it to go on. Deal with it immediately. So fix those kinds of things quickly. Because otherwise they get worse and you may bury them for a while only to see them raise their head in an uglier form down the road. So I think you want to address even the beginnings of something that feels like it might be a betrayal. Even one of these minor betrayals.\n\nSo this idea about being realistic about the potential for recovery really comes into assessing the nature of the betrayal. If it is a serious betrayal, an infidelity, something that is really attacking you at your core, many divorces happen over this kind of thing and it\u2019s really better off that people separate because there\u2019s no point in trying to make something work that just won\u2019t work. Within a company framework I always say that you need to get the wrong people off the bus. There are people in most companies that shouldn\u2019t be there and therefore you need to \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a betrayal of them to keep them on the bus and they\u2019re betraying the company by staying on the bus. So I think some things you just have to address and move on and just say this is a betrayal I\u2019m not going to try to fix.  Read Full Transcript Here:  http://goo.gl/I8Clcf.",

There, officials listen to what are sometimes the pilots' final, panicked moments of life. They interpret not only what the pilots were saying before the crash but also any snaps, bangs, and alarms captured by the cockpit area microphone.\n\nBy combining those audio clues with data from the plane's instruments and sensors, as well as evidence from the scene, investigators can usually determine the cause of the crash, even in cases with no surviving witnesses.\n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Little research has been done on the function of Duvernoy\u2019s glands in non-venomous snakes but in most species, its secretions appear to be used as lubrication to aid in swallowing. Enzymes are also produced that may aid in killing, paralyzing, and digesting prey but these functions appear to be limited in their power and are only found in certain species. \nhttp://people.whitman.edu/~jacksok/ZJLS.pdf\n\nhttp://www.public.wsu.edu/~kkardong/Web%20of%20KVK_06b/Publications/Evolution_venom_app82.pdf\n\n============================\nHow do blood clots form?\n============================\nRead an overview of how the blood clotting cascade functions and may have evolved:\nhttp://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/DI/clot/Clotting.html\n\nWatch a cool 3D animation showing how Factor X interacts with other molecules and structures in the blood to form clots!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy3a__OOa2M",

But it can change the strategy and has more real world applications as it resembles a relationship.\n\nTHE PRISONER'S DILEMMA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw\n\nFOOT NOTES\nAdditional requirements for an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game\n\nFor a one off prisoner\u2019s dilemma, they payoffs can just be like 5 greater than 3 greater than 1 greater than 0 (like in the video). But for an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game to be an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, the total payout for both cooperating has to be bigger than the total payout for one person cooperating and one person defecting. Basically 2x3 greater than 5+0. \nIf it was like 8 points for defecting while the other cooperates, it would still follow the on off prisoners dilemma format, 8 greater than 3 greater than 1 greater than 0. But with an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game the best strategy would be to go back and forth between cooperating and defecting (giving them on average 4 each, rather than 3 for both cooperating). Which can happen for sure, but it\u2019s a different sort of game.\nWith a one-off prisoner\u2019s dilemma this doesn\u2019t matter so much. Trade might change the relationship, but it should still appear as a prisoner\u2019s dilemma. The incentives that make it the prisoner\u2019s dilemma would be the same. Their best strategies would still be to always defect. \n\n\nTournament 1 vs tournament 2 (A set number of rounds vs not knowing when it ends)\n\nThere is a bit of a logical quirk when the players know how many rounds there are. A big part of game theory is getting into your opponents head, predicting what they will do. Also thinking about the whole game and reasoning backwards.\nSo when they know how many rounds there are, the last round against any given opponent, has no consequences. If you defect in the first round the opponent can reciprocate and you probably won\u2019t be better off or it. But an opponent can\u2019t reciprocate against any defecting in that last round. And since no matter what the other person is going to do, defecting gives a better payout. A player should defect in the last round... so should everyone really. They will only get more for doing that. We should expect them to do it.\nBut then if everyone is defecting in the last round, not in response to anything that happened before, then really the second to last round also has no consequences. Nobody is going to defect because you defected in the second to last round. What they\u2019re doing in that next round is already set, if we defect in the second to last round we\u2019re not giving up future gains we could have gotten while cooperating. So everyone should defect in the second to last round because there are no consequences and the payoff is higher. But then if everyone is defecting in these rounds, then the third to last round also has no consequences\u2026. Blah blah, defect the whole time. With this reasoning the correct strategy is to always defect. \nBut we already know that ALWAYS DEFECT isn\u2019t a great strategy here. Because defecting has consequences. \nBut reasoning backwards, in this context, only works if everyone is doing it. If everyone has thought that way. If everyone reasoned this way, then everyone is always defecting. Then always defecting is the best strategy against that.  \nBut the people who submitted for this tournament clearly didn\u2019t reason this way. \nMaybe because most of the time in the real world, we don\u2019t know how many rounds there are, so we always think our actions will have consequences. Also we rarely interact with one person in isolation. We can build a reputation for being un-cooperative. If we are dicks to people who we are about to never see again those who will may not want to cooperate with us as much. So those who submitted thought like this. \nMaybe because they didn\u2019t know about the idea. \nBut even still, in the context of that tournament it would still better to defect in the last round. I suspect TIT FOR TAT or FORGIVING TIT FOR TAT modified to defect in the last round would have won... in the tournaments at least. If you're done with a relationship and you kill them and take your stuff, the people watching you won'y want to cooperate with you.\nFor that tournament they actually changed the definition of what a \u201cnice\u201d strategy was to allow defecting in those last few rounds against an opponent. The weird space where the two ideas meet.\n\n\nCooperating with whom? \n\nCooperation and defection refer to between the two players. Not necessarily with outside forces like with the police.\n\nPatreon https://patreon.com/user?u=849925",

    "description": "source paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1489\r\n\r\nWe use SPH simulations with an approximate radiative cooling prescription to model evolution of a massive and large (100 AU) very young protoplanetary disc. We also model dust growth and gas-grain dynamics with a second fluid approach. It is found that the disc fragments onto a large number of 10 Jupiter mass clumps that cool and contract slowly. Some of the clumps evolve onto eccentric orbits delivering them into the inner tens of AU, where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star. Dust grows and sediments inside the clumps, displaying a very strong segregation, with the largest particles forming dense cores in the centers. The density of the dust cores may exceed that of the gas and is limited only by the numerical constraints, indicating that these cores should collapse into rocky planetary cores. One particular giant planet embryo migrates inward close enough to be disrupted at about 10 AU, leaving a self-bound solid core of about 7.5 Earth's mass on a low eccentricity orbit at a radius of 8 AU. These simulations support the recent suggestions that terrestrial and giant planets may be the remnants of tidally disrupted giant planet embryos.\r\n\r\ncredit: Seung-Hoon Cha, Sergei Nayakshin\r\n\r\nsource: http://www.astro.le.ac.uk/~shc14/",

Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas, principal scientist at Google, works with deep neural networks for machine perception and distributed learning. In this captivating demo, he shows how neural nets trained to recognize images can be run in reverse, to generate them. The results: spectacular, hallucinatory collages (and poems!) that defy categorization. \"Perception and creativity are very intimately connected,\" Ag\u00fcera y Arcas says. \"Any creature, any being that is able to do perceptual acts is also able to create.\"\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

It has issues because it blankets both common pool resources with no communication, no rules, no accountability, no punishment for those who break the rules, etc. (open access) and common pool resources with some cooperation or institution in place (common property regimes). \n\nWhen you get away from those aspects that allow people to trust one another and work together, the system looks like an open access system.

    "description": "You can now support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/statedclearly\n\nAll living creatures today reproduce and evolve using a complex gene-enzyme cycle. If we look at a cell, for example, information encoded in its genes is used to produce functional proteins called enzymes. Some of those enzymes then turn around to make copies of the cell's genes, allowing the cell to reproduce. \n\nBecause the gene-enzyme system forms a closed loop, it presents us with a classic chicken or egg conundrum: Which came first, genes or the protein enzymes they code for? \n\nWhile the details are still not fully worked out, discoveries over the past few decades have lead researchers to a surprising possible solution: What really came first? Genes that act as enzymes!\n\nThe RNA World Hypothesis is the idea that before living cells, the genetic code, and the gene/protein cycle ever existed, chains of a chemical called RNA were forming naturally. Once formed, some of these chains were able to function as enzymes, and were even able to evolve by making copies of themselves with slight, accidental modifications.\n\nWhile there is little doubt that RNA played a crucial role in the early development of life, the complexity of RNA is casting doubt on the idea that RNA was the first truly replicating and evolving chemical system. For this reason, alternatives to the \u201cRNA first\u201d view are also being investigated. Most notable is a proto-RNA hypothesis being studied by the lab of Nicholas Hud, and several metabolism first hypotheses which got their start from the work of Robert Shapiro.\n\nAt this time, all serious investigations into the origin of life are being done under the overarching idea that life emerged from chemistry.\n\nSOURCES AND FURTHER READING\n\nRIBOZYMES\nThe first RNA enzymes were discovered in 1982, now known as ribozymes. Here\u2019s is a wonderful review of what we now know about ribozymes (well... as of 2002): \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770912/\n\nDiverse and highly functional ribozymes can be evolved in the lab. Selection experiments have shown there are many pathways that evolution can take to produce a ribozyme with a given function. This means the evolution of function is much simpler than previously thought! \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902939/\n\nNucleotide building ribozymes have been evolved in the lab from random starting chains (this is the experiment discussed in our animation):\n\nScientific Paper: http://www.sfu.ca/~punrau/pdfs/Lau_JACS_2004.pdf\n\nINITIAL RNA NUCLEOTIDE SYNTHESIS\nRNA nucleotides have been shown to form without enzymes under conditions that might have been plausible on the early Earth. That said, the reactions we\u2019ve discovered so far do not appear robust enough to claim that the problem is fully solved: \n\nScientific Paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/abs/nature08013.html\n\n\nNature News overview of the discovery with objections discussed: http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090513/full/news.2009.471.html\n\nRNA REPLICATION BEFORE EVOLUTION OF ENZYMES\n8 problems with RNA replication and likely solutions to them (note: number 8 now has two independent solutions demonstrated in the lab): \n\nScientific Paper: https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-3-2\n\nALTERNATIVES TO THE RNA WORLD HYPOTHESIS \nHere is an article reviewing the metabolism first hypothesis in contrast to the RNA first view:\n\nBlog post by professor Laurance Moran: http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/metabolism-first-and-origin-of-life.html\n\nHere is an article reviewing research into a possible proto RNA World Hypothesis: \n\nMedia article by quanta magazine\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/20140205-chemists-pursue-possible-precursor-to-rna/\n\nLearn more about evolution and the origin of life at http://statedclearly.com and at http://centerforchemicalevolution.com",

This is also known as \"free energy\", and one way of thinking about entropy is as the lack of free energy. The sun provides us with useful, low entropy, energy in the form of photons of visible light, which are then absorbed and converted into plants, sugar, complex molecules, etc, before being radiated back into space as heat, which has much higher entropy.\n\nMusic for the series was especially composed by Nathaniel Schroeder, http://www.soundcloud.com/drschroeder\n\nREFERENCES & ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nEntropy Balance of Radiation of the Earth system http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038092X9290097T\n\nHeat balance of global warming/climate change: http://www.skepticalscience.com/4-Hiroshima-bombs-worth-of-heat-per-second.html\n\nMore on the Entropy Balance of the Earth System https://www.bnl.gov/envsci/pubs/pdf/2010/BNL-81482-2008-JA.pdf\n\nThe Entropy of a Photon Gas: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_gas\n\nSean's blog: http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/05/11/big-picture-part-four-complexity/\n\nAnother article by Sean about complexity and god: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/writings/dtung/\n\nSean Carroll: The Big Picture\n(more great articles about entropy, etc on his blog http://preposterousuniverse.com)\n\nInteractive Entropy explainer by Aatish Bhatia: http://aatishb.github.io/entropy/\n\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on Google+ - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6 \nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd twitter - @minutephysics\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Also, due to the nature of my videos, there are bound to be oversimplifications. Some of these are intentional because I don\u2019t have time to go into full detail, but sometimes they are unintentional and here is where I clear them up.\n\n1. \u201cIsaac Newton invented calculus.\u201d Actually there is controversy over who invented calculus first Isaac Newton or Gottfried Leibniz. Regardless of who it was I have used Leibniz\u2019s mathematical notation here and so he definitely deserves credit. I did\u2019t know about all this so thanks to those who pointed it out. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy\n2. \u201cMaxwell derived the laws of electromagnetism.\u201d This is a simplification as Maxwell\u2019s work was built on the backs of other scientists like Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, Andr\u00e9-Marie Ampl\u00e8re and Michael Faraday who discovered induction and saw that electricity and magnetism were part of the same thing. But it was Maxwell who worked out all the maths and brought electricity and magnetism together into a unified theory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism#History_of_the_theory\n3. \u201cEntropy is a measure of order and disorder\u201d. This is also a simplification and this does a good job of explaining it better https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy\n4. Einstein and Quantum physics: I made it sound like quantum physics was built by people other than Einstein, but this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Einstein got a Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect which was a key result to show the particle-like nature of light. Funnily enough he never got a nobel prize for his work on Relativity!\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this video, you will probably like my science books, available in all good books shops around the work and is printed in 16 languages. Links are below or just search for Professor Astro Cat. They are fun children's books aimed at the age range 7-12. But they are also a hit with adults who want good explanations of science.

The weird results of quantum experiments seem to demand weird explanations of the nature of reality.

We're going to start with the Big Bang, take you right through all of history (recorded and otherwise), and even talk a little bit about the future. It is going to be awesome. In the awe-inspiring sense of the word awesome. In this episode, we walk you through the start of everything: The Big Bang. We'll look at how the universe unfolded at its very beginning, and how everything in the universe that we know today came into being. So that's kind of a big deal, right?\n\nFor more information, visit www.bighistoryproject.com",

This transition, as well as several other major evolutionary transitions, dramatically increased the complexity of lifeforms on our planet. \n\nIf you enjoyed the show, please consider supporting us at patreon.com/statedclearly\n\nto see the animation on bees, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J83qyLXAsN4\n\n------------SOURCES------------\n\nOVERVIEW OF MAJOR TRANSITIONS\n\nThis animation was based on a paper by Stuart West et al called Major Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality which can be accessed free here: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10112.full.pdf\n\nDr West's paper defines major transitions in a slightly narrower way than earlier workers on the subject. For a broader definition see the book by John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry on the topic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Major_Transitions_in_Evolution\n\nMITOCHONDRIA\n\nThe paper by Dr Margulis (Sagan) on the origin of mitochondria. Note that in it she presents several ideas cautiously as hypothesis. While some aspects of the paper are now known to be incorrect, she was spot on about the origin of mitochondria: http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge246/endosymbiotictheory_marguli.pdf\n\nVIROIDS\n\nThe free living genes discovered by Dr Diener were made of RNA. Here is a paper on them: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682271903424\n\nHere is an excellent Wikipedia article on them I suggest looking over first. It includes a schematic of the species Diener found: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viroid \n\nEXPERIMENTS SHOWN IN THIS ANIMATION\n\nPhagotrophy by a flagellate selects for colonial prey: A possible origin of multicellularity: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006527528063\n\nExperimental evolution of multicellularity:\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/109/5/1595\n\nAuto-/heterotrophic endosymbiosis evolves in a mature stage of ecosystem development in a microcosm composed of an alga, a bacterium and a ciliate [what a catchy title!]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19162125",

Manual and automatic transmissions are completely different technologies, which use different configurations and principles. One is based on a simple gear pair, while the other is based on a planetary gear set. One uses a torque convertor, while the other uses a clutch pack.

    "description": "Everything you need to know about gravitational waves. In February 2016 scientists announced the first detection of gravitational waves by humans on Earth. This was a huge, world changing, discovery. The gravitational waves were caused by a pair of colliding black holes 1.3 billion light years away 1.3 billion years ago. This video summaries all the of the mind blowing facts about the gravitational waves and describes LIGO, the incredibly sensitive telescope that detected them.\n\nIf you would like to buy a poster you can get one here http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/24649310-gravitational-wave-astronomy?asc=u&p=poster&rel=carousel\n\nErrata and clarifications.\n\nI endeavour to be as accurate as possible in my videos, but I am human and definitely don\u2019t know everything, so there are sometimes mistakes. Also, because my videos are summaries of some quite complex science, I make simplifications. Some of these are intentional because I don\u2019t have time to go into full detail, but sometimes they are unintentional and here is where I clear them up.\n\n1. I got the month of the original detection wrong! It was September 2015, not November 2015. Silly me, my apologies.\n2. \u201c1.3 billion years ago, 1.3 billion light years away\u201d This is incorrect and an oversight on my part. I completely forgot to take into account the expansion of the Universe. The resulting black hole is 1.3 billion light years from us today, but was closer to us when the collision happened, which means that it happened less than 1.3 billion years ago. I tried to work out exactly when but was stumped because I couldn\u2019t find the function for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. The redshift of the signal from the black holes was about 10%, so I thought the collision was 10% closer in time than 1.3 billion years i.e. 1.18 billion years, but I think it might be a bit more complicated than that. \n3. LIGO schematic animation. I made a couple of silly errors here. The first circular mirror that the laser hits should be 90\u00ba to the way I oriented it: half the laser light is transmitted and half reflected, each one going up a different arm.\n4. LIGO schematic animation. When the laser bounced back and forth it should bounce between the two suspended mirrors and not go all the way back to the diagonal mirror.\n5. VIRGO is near Pisa, not at Trento as I drew on the map. I said the right thing but drew the wrong thing. My apologies.\n6. \u2018A second even more powerful collision.\u201d Wrong again! The second collision was less powerful and the signal was more buried in the noise.\n\nI\u2019m not happy with the number of flat out mistakes I made on this one! I will try better in the future. I blame it on the Christmas spirits.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about gravitational waves and the detection here are the original papers and some very informative links.\n\nMain LIGO scientific paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102\nSupplementary LIGO paper: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L22\n\nArticles:\nhttp://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/feb/11/ligo-detects-first-ever-gravitational-waves-from-two-merging-black-holes\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/black-hole-collision-energy-50-times-universe-2016-2\nhttp://www.space.com/33176-gravitational-waves-from-second-black-hole-collision.html\nhttp://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/gravitational-waves-6-cosmic-questions-they-can-tackle-1.19337\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nWhat they sound like:\nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/6/15/11948618/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-hole-sound\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this video, you will probably like my science books, available in all good books shops around the work and is printed in 16 languages.

    "description": "Research assignment: Teach me about spin.\n\nBelow there are suggested questions, recommended sources and my social media accounts:\n\nQUESTIONS:\nQuestions that require less research:\n1. This is our first real example of quantization, the phenomena that gives quantum mechanics it\u2019s name. Here\u2019s what it means. In the classical case of magnets going through a Stern Gerlach machine, the magnets can end up any where in the range. But in quantum mechanics, its can only be exactly up or down, these discrete values rather than a continuous range in between. This sort of quantization really bothered physicists. Can you understand why? And is there any classical physics phenomenon that also has sort of quantization?\n\n2. Do you think that eventually all quantities in physics can be explained in terms of deeper physics? Are there any examples of quantities that later on did get explained through a more encompassing theory?\n\n3. How can you use the Stern-Gerlach machine to measure spin in the \u2018forward-backward\u2019 direction? \n\n4. Why do half the particles go left, half right at 4:24? \n\n\n\nQuestions that (probably) require research:\n\n5. What are bosons and fermions? What\u2019s spin got to do with it? If you really want to get into it, read ch 4, volume 3 of The Feynman Lectures: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html\n\n6. Electrons are so-called spin 1/2 particles. Are there any other spin types? What determines what spin a particle will have?\n\n7. How does spin relate to the Pauli exclusion principle?\n\n8. Explain how the Stern-Gerlach machine works\n\n9. Is light polarization a type of spin? What are arguments for and against this? What spin does a photon have (spin 1/2, spin 1 etc)?\n\n10. Why is it that charged particles moving causes magnetic fields- according to Einstein? (Look up relativity and electromagnetism)\n\n11. What\u2019s wrong with saying the electron is infinitely small? What experiments measure the electrons size? Are protons also infinitely small? \n\n12. Find other reasons we don\u2019t believe electrons are actually spinning. (An interesting one is about rotating a spin particle 360 degrees, and not getting back the exact same wavefunction.)\n\n13. a) What is the Bloch Sphere, and why can we use it to represent spin? How do you visualise the spin left state on it? how about spin forward? (http://comp.uark.edu/~jgeabana/blochapps/bloch.html , note that a 2-level system is any particle that only has two options when measured (eg only up or down). |0) and |1) are the generic labels we\u2019ll put on these options)\nb) Also, How do you write spin forward in terms of up and down (i.e. |forward)=a|up)+b|down))? You will probably need to look this up, so it\u2019s useful to know the spin \u201cup/down\u201dness is usually called spin in the z direction, spin \u201cleft/right\u201dness is spin in the x direction, and spin \u201cforward/backward\u201d is spin in the y direction. You can figure this out by looking at the Bloch sphere.\n\n14. Magnetic Resonance Imaginging (MRI) is an important clinical technic that completely relies on manipulating spin. Explain it! http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetic_resonance_imaging\n\n15. What happens to the electrons if you put them into the Stern-Gerlach machine and then slowly rotated from up and down to side and side, do some of the electrons switch places? (Thank you Majoofi)\n\n16. Why aren't there magnetic monopoles? (Thanks Culwin)\n\n17. What is isospin? Why is it that, even though it hasn't got the units of angular momentum, it still 'formally acts like spin?' according to Wiki? (Thanks Hythloday71)\n\nRECOMMENDED SOURCES ON SPIN\nThe Feynman lectures, Volume 3: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html\n\nQuantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particle Physics- Eisberg and Resnick, the chapters of angular momentum and spin. This is a good one if you already know basic classical electromagnetism. Don't buy it, just visit your local university library and just read it there. \n\nSneaking a Look at God's Cards - Ghirardi. This is one of my favourite quantum books. It talks about the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n\nWikipedia or Scholarpedia. These are always a good place to start- though sometimes they can throw you into the maths. Don't panic if you don't get all of it. Just try to glean the main idea, and that's more than enough to report here. Hopefully then others can help with any details that were confusing. \n\nThe Story of Spin.  Thank you Michael Sommers for the recommendation. I haven't read it, but it seems good! Hard to find though.\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1349918.The_Story_of_Spin \n\nA Veritasium and Minute Physics video about electromagnetism! Thanks EnellGmz for reminding me about it. https://youtu.be/1TKSfAkWWN0\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA:\n\nTwitter:\n@Looking_glass_u\n\nFacebook\nwww.facebook.com/LookingGlassUniverse\n\nTumblr \nhttp://looking-glass-universe.tumblr.com/",
